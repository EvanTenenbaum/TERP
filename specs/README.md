# Test Specifications (specs/)

This directory contains Markdown test plans generated by Playwright's AI Planner agent and human-authored specifications.

## Purpose

Test specifications serve as:
1. **Input for Generator Agent**: Markdown plans are converted to executable Playwright tests
2. **Documentation**: Human-readable descriptions of test coverage
3. **Review Artifacts**: Plans can be reviewed before generating tests

## Spec Format

Specs follow Playwright's expected Markdown format:

```markdown
# Feature: [Feature Name]

## Background
[Context and prerequisites]

## Scenario: [Scenario Name]
Given [precondition]
When [action]
Then [expected result]

## Scenario: [Another Scenario]
...
```

## Generating Specs

Use the Planner agent to generate specs:

```bash
# Generate spec for entire app
pnpm test:e2e:ai:plan

# Or manually with specific URL
npx playwright ai plan http://localhost:5173/orders
```

## Converting Specs to Tests

Use the Generator agent:

```bash
# Generate tests from a spec
pnpm test:e2e:ai:generate specs/core/orders-workflow.md

# Or manually
npx playwright ai generate specs/core/orders-workflow.md
```

## Best Practices

1. **Review before generating**: Always review AI-generated specs before converting to tests
2. **Add edge cases**: Manually add business-specific edge cases to specs
3. **Keep specs focused**: One spec per feature/workflow
4. **Version control**: Commit both specs and generated tests
5. **Update regularly**: Regenerate specs when features change significantly
