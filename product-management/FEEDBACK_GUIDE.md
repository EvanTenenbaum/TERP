# Adding Feedback & Ideas to Existing Features

**How to give feedback on specific features, sections, or add ideas to existing work**

---

## TL;DR

**Manus will interpret it perfectly.** Just be natural and use references.

**Examples**:
```
"Add dark mode support to [TERP-FEAT-015]"
"The inventory filters should also filter by supplier"
"[TERP-FEAT-018] needs a 'clear all' button"
"I want the dashboard to show profit margins"
```

The Idea Inbox agent will:
1. Understand what you're referring to
2. Link it to the existing feature
3. Create the right type of item (improvement, new idea, or bug)
4. Store it properly

---

## Method 1: Natural Language (Recommended)

**Just talk naturally and mention the feature**

### Example 1: Adding to Existing Feature

**You say**:
```
"The inventory filters should also filter by supplier, not just category"
```

**Idea Inbox agent responds**:
```
‚úì Captured as [TERP-IMPROVE-001]
üìÇ improvements/TERP-IMPROVE-001-filter-by-supplier.md
üè∑Ô∏è inventory, filters, enhancement
üîó Related to: [TERP-FEAT-015] Advanced Inventory Filters
üìç Type: IMPROVE (enhancement to existing feature)

üí° Analysis:
This extends [TERP-FEAT-015] which currently filters by category, 
status, and date range. Adding supplier filter would require:
- Update filter UI component
- Add supplier dropdown
- Update filter logic
- Estimated: 1-2 hours

Would you like to:
1. Add this to [TERP-FEAT-015] backlog
2. Create as separate feature [TERP-FEAT-020]
3. Implement immediately
```

---

### Example 2: Feedback on In-Progress Feature

**You say**:
```
"[TERP-FEAT-018] needs a 'clear all' button for saved filters"
```

**Idea Inbox agent responds**:
```
‚úì Captured as [TERP-IMPROVE-002]
üìÇ improvements/TERP-IMPROVE-002-clear-all-saved-filters.md
üè∑Ô∏è filters, ux, quick-win
üîó Related to: [TERP-FEAT-018] Saved Filter Views (in-progress)
üìç Type: IMPROVE

üí° Note:
[TERP-FEAT-018] is currently in progress. I'll:
1. Add this to the feature's backlog
2. Update dev-brief.md with this requirement
3. Notify the dev agent working on it

The dev agent will see this feedback and can incorporate it 
before completing the feature.

Updated: features/in-progress/TERP-FEAT-018-.../backlog.md
```

### Example 3: New Idea Related to Existing Feature

**You say**:
```
"I want the dashboard to show profit margins per product"
```

**Idea Inbox agent responds**:
```
‚úì Captured as [TERP-IDEA-005]
üìÇ ideas/inbox/TERP-IDEA-005-dashboard-profit-margins.md
üè∑Ô∏è dashboard, analytics, profit, metrics
üîó Related to: 
  - [@module/dashboard] (existing module)
  - [@module/accounting] (profit data source)
  - [TERP-FEAT-012] Accounting Integration (completed)
üìç Type: IDEA (new feature)

üí° Analysis:
This is a new dashboard feature. It would:
- Add profit margin widget to dashboard
- Pull data from accounting module
- Show per-product breakdown
- Estimated: 4-6 hours

Dependencies:
- [TERP-FEAT-012] Accounting Integration ‚úì (complete)
- Access to COGS and pricing data ‚úì (available)

## Method 2: Using References (Most Precise)

**When you know the exact feature ID**

### Adding Improvement to Existing Feature

**You say**:
```
"Add to [TERP-FEAT-015]: Filter by supplier"
```

**Idea Inbox agent responds**:
```
‚úì Created [TERP-IMPROVE-001]
üîó Linked to [TERP-FEAT-015]: Advanced Inventory Filters
üìÅ Added to: features/completed/TERP-FEAT-015-.../improvements.md

This improvement is now tracked under [TERP-FEAT-015].

Next steps:
- Review all improvements: Check features/.../TERP-FEAT-015-.../improvements.md
- Batch implement: "Implement improvements for [TERP-FEAT-015]"
- Or implement individually: "Implement [TERP-IMPROVE-001]"
```

### Adding Feedback to In-Progress Feature

**You say**:
```
"Feedback on [TERP-FEAT-018]: The save button should be more prominent"
```

**Idea Inbox agent responds**:
```
‚úì Captured as feedback for [TERP-FEAT-018]
üìÅ Added to: features/in-progress/TERP-FEAT-018-.../feedback.md

**Feedback**: Save button prominence
**Type**: UX improvement
**Priority**: Medium

I've updated the dev-brief.md to include this feedback.

The dev agent working on [TERP-FEAT-018] will see this and 
can adjust the UI before completion.

Would you like me to:
1. Notify the dev agent now
2. Add as acceptance criterion
3. Create separate improvement ticket
```

---

## Method 3: Structured Format (Optional)

**For very specific feedback**

**You say**:
```
Feature: [TERP-FEAT-015]
Type: Improvement
Priority: High
Description: Add supplier filter to inventory filters
Reason: Users often need to see inventory by supplier
```

**Idea Inbox agent responds**:

## How Manus Interprets Context

### Smart Linking

**You say**: "The filters are slow with lots of items"

**Manus understands**:
- "filters" ‚Üí Likely [TERP-FEAT-015] Advanced Inventory Filters
- "slow" ‚Üí Performance issue
- "lots of items" ‚Üí Edge case with large datasets

**Creates**: [TERP-BUG-001] linked to [TERP-FEAT-015]

---

### Contextual Classification

**You say**: "Add dark mode"

**Manus classifies as**:
- Type: IDEA (new feature)
- Module: Core/Theme
- Scope: System-wide
- Complexity: Medium

**You say**: "The export button doesn't work on mobile"

**Manus classifies as**:
- Type: BUG
- Related: [TERP-FEAT-019] (if export feature exists)
- Severity: HIGH (broken functionality)
- Platform: Mobile

---

### Relationship Detection

**You say**: "Users want to export their saved filter views"

**Manus detects**:
- Related to: [TERP-FEAT-018] Saved Filter Views
- Related to: [TERP-FEAT-019] CSV Export
- Type: IDEA (combines two features)
- Opportunity: Could be added to either feature

**Suggests**:
```
üí° This combines [TERP-FEAT-018] and [TERP-FEAT-019].

Options:
1. Add to [TERP-FEAT-018] as enhancement
2. Add to [TERP-FEAT-019] as enhancement
3. Create new feature [TERP-FEAT-020] that depends on both

Recommendation: Add to [TERP-FEAT-019] since export logic 
already exists. Just need to accept saved view as input.
```

---

## Best Practices

### DO ‚úÖ

**Be specific**:
```
Good: "Add supplier filter to [TERP-FEAT-015]"
Bad: "Filters need more options"
```

**Use references when you know them**:
```
Good: "[TERP-FEAT-018] needs a clear button"
Good: "The saved filters feature needs a clear button"
Both work, but reference is clearer
```

**Provide context**:
```
Good: "Export button doesn't work on mobile - gets cut off"
Bad: "Export broken"
```

**Mention related features**:
```
Good: "This relates to the export feature we just built"
Manus will link it automatically
```

---

### DON'T ‚ùå

**Don't worry about perfect classification**:
```
You: "The filters should also do X"
Manus will figure out if it's:
- Improvement to existing feature
- New feature
- Bug fix
- Enhancement
```

**Don't worry about finding the exact ID**:
```
You: "The inventory filter thing"
Manus: "Did you mean [TERP-FEAT-015]?"
```

**Don't overthink the format**:
```
Natural language works perfectly:
"I think the dashboard should show profit margins"
```
