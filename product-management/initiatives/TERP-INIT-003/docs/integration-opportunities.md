## Recommended Additions to Phase 1

Based on business value and implementation complexity, I recommend adding these to Phase 1:
#### 1. **Sales Sheet Follow-ups & Reminders**
**Why:** Directly impacts revenue, low implementation complexity, high ROI, user-controlled flexibility

**Implementation:**
- Add "Set Reminder" button/field in sales sheet creation/edit UI
- User chooses reminder time: "In X days", "On [specific date/time]", "Next [day of week] at [time]"
- Multiple reminders per sales sheet (e.g., "3 days" and "1 week")
- Show pending sales sheet reminders in calendar views
- Allow manual scheduling of demos and negotiation calls
- Show sales cycle timeline in client profile# 2. Credit & Collections Workflow
**Why:** Reduces bad debt, improves cash flow, integrates with existing AP/AR work

**Implementation:**
- Auto-generate credit review event when client reaches 80% of limit
- Auto-generate collections events for overdue invoices (30, 60, 90 days)
- Show collections calendar in accounting manager view
- Track payment plan installment dates
