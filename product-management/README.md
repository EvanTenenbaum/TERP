---

## Key Features

### 1. Unique ID System
Every idea, feature, and bug gets a memorable ID:
- `TERP-FEAT-015` - Features
- `TERP-IDEA-042` - Ideas
- `TERP-BUG-008` - Bugs

**No more**: "That export thing we talked about"  
**Instead**: `[TERP-FEAT-019]` - crystal clear reference

### 2. Reference System
Clear, unambiguous communication:
```
[TERP-FEAT-015]           → Specific feature
[@bible]                  → Development protocols
[@module/inventory]       → Module documentation
[@file:client/src/App.tsx] → Specific file
```

### 3. Intelligent Caching
Codebase analysis that learns:
- First run: Analyzes all 437 files (0.3s)
- Subsequent runs: Only changed files (80-90% cache hit rate)
- **Saves massive amounts of credits**

### 4. Multi-Chat Architecture
Specialized chats for different purposes:
- **Idea Inbox**: Capture anything, anytime
- **Feature Planning**: Turn ideas into detailed specs
- **Development**: One chat per feature (parallel work!)
- **QA Agent**: Comprehensive testing

### 5. Auto-Generated Dev-Briefs
The magic file that contains EVERYTHING a dev agent needs:
- Complete context (Bible, architecture, module docs)
- Implementation checklist
- Files to modify
- Technical considerations
- Definition of done
- Progress tracking

**Result**: Zero copy-paste. Just load one file.

### 6. Search & Discovery
Fast search across all content:
```bash
search.py "export"
search.py "inventory" --type FEAT
search.py "" --status in-progress
```

### 7. Dependency Tracking
Automatic dependency management:
- What blocks this feature?
- What does this feature block?
- What's the critical path?
- Are there conflicts?

## Quick Start

**See**: `QUICK_START.md` for 5-minute tutorial

**Full guide**: `USER_GUIDE.md` for complete documentation

**TL;DR**:
1. Load chat context file
2. Say what you want
3. System handles the rest

- Relevance scoring
- Fast lookups

### 3. Codebase Analyzer (`scripts/analyze-codebase.py`)
- Incremental analysis
- Intelligent caching
- Module detection
- Dependency mapping

### 4. Chat Contexts (`chat-contexts/`)
- Inbox: Idea capture
- Planning: Feature specs
- QA: Quality assurance
- Each has complete instructions and workflows

### 5. Templates (`templates/`)
- Dev-brief template
- Progress tracking template
- PRD template
- Bug report template

---

## Workflows

### Idea → Feature → Production

**Step 1**: Capture (30 sec)
```
Idea Inbox Chat: "Users want CSV export"
→ [TERP-IDEA-001] created
```

**Step 2**: Plan (2 min)
```
Feature Planning Chat: "Build [TERP-IDEA-001]"
→ [TERP-FEAT-001] with PRD, tech spec, dev-brief
```

**Step 3**: Develop (varies)
```
Dev Chat: "Implement [TERP-FEAT-001]
          Context: .../dev-brief.md"
→ Feature implemented
```

**Step 4**: QA (3-30 min)
```
QA Chat: "QA [TERP-FEAT-001] at Level 3"
→ Comprehensive test report
```

**Step 5**: Ship
```
Merge and deploy!
```

## Key Innovations

### 1. Dev-Brief Auto-Generation
**Problem**: Dev agents need tons of context  
**Solution**: Auto-generate one file with everything  
**Result**: Zero copy-paste, perfect context every time

### 2. Incremental Codebase Analysis
**Problem**: Analyzing 437 files every time is expensive  
**Solution**: Cache results, only re-analyze changed files  
**Result**: 80-90% cost savings after first run

### 3. Reference System
**Problem**: "That feature" is ambiguous  
**Solution**: `[TERP-FEAT-015]` is crystal clear  
**Result**: No confusion, ever

### 4. Multi-Chat Parallel Development
**Problem**: One chat gets too long, can't work in parallel  
**Solution**: One chat per feature, each loads context  
**Result**: Multiple agents working simultaneously

### 5. Thought Partnership (Not Judgment)
**Problem**: PM tools often prescribe solutions  
**Solution**: Provide data and options, user decides  
**Result**: Strategic guidance without imposing

## Performance

### Codebase Analysis
- **First run**: 437 files in 0.3 seconds
- **Subsequent runs**: ~50 files in 0.05 seconds (90% cache hit)
- **Cost savings**: 80-90% reduction

### Search
- **Index build**: < 1 second
- **Search query**: < 0.1 seconds
- **Supports**: Full-text, filters, relevance scoring

### Storage
- **Current size**: ~85KB (text files)
- **Scales to**: 1000+ features easily
- **Cost**: $0 (GitHub free tier)

---

## Quality Assurance

### QA Levels

**Level 2** (5-10 min, ~$0.10-0.20):
- Automated checks
- Basic manual testing
- For small changes

**Level 3** (20-30 min, ~$0.40-0.60):
- Comprehensive testing
- All user flows
- For most features

**Level 4** (1-2 hours, ~$2-4):
- Full system validation
- Before production releases

### QA Coverage

- ✅ Static analysis (TypeScript, linting)
- ✅ Code review (design system, patterns)
- ✅ Functional testing (happy path + edge cases)
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- ✅ Integration testing (data flow, navigation)
- ✅ Accessibility (WCAG AA compliance)
- ✅ Performance (load times, rendering)

---

## Best Practices

### DO ✅
- Use references for clarity (`[TERP-FEAT-015]`)
- One chat per feature (parallel development)
- Update progress regularly
- Run QA before merge
- Keep codebase analysis current

### DON'T ❌
- Describe features vaguely ("that thing")
- Reuse dev chats for multiple features
- Skip QA for "small" changes
- Forget to update progress
- Let codebase analysis get stale

---

## Integration with TERP

### How It Fits
- PM system references existing docs via `[@bible]`, `[@context]`
- Codebase analysis reads actual code
- Features integrate with existing workflows
- No disruption to current development

---

## Maintenance

### Daily (Automated)

```

**"Context not loading"**
```bash
ls -la product-management/_system/chat-contexts/
```

**"Analysis slow"**
```bash
# Check cache hit rate
cat product-management/_system/cache/analysis-cache.json
