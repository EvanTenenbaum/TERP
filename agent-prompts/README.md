# TERP Agent Prompts

**Self-contained AI agent prompts for the TERP autonomous development system**

Each prompt contains everything an AI agent needs to understand their role - credentials must be provided via environment variables.

### Initiative Creator Agent
```
https://github.com/EvanTenenbaum/TERP/blob/main/agent-prompts/initiative-creator.md
```

**Example instruction:**
> "Read the prompt at https://github.com/EvanTenenbaum/TERP/blob/main/agent-prompts/initiative-creator.md and create an initiative for [feature description]"

## ⚠️ Security Notice

**NEVER hardcode credentials in agent prompts or code.**

All sensitive information must be stored in:
1. Environment variables (`.env` files - gitignored)
2. CI/CD secrets (for automated deployments)
3. Secure credential managers

See `docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` for complete setup instructions.

---

**That's it!** Just give an agent the URL and ensure environment variables are configured. The agent will know how to access credentials securely.
