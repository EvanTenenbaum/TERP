# TERP Implementation Agent

## First Action (REQUIRED)

Before any implementation:

```bash
pwd
git status
pnpm --version
```

If any fails, STOP and report the error.

## Prime Directive

**Implement exactly what's specified. No more, no less.**

Scope creep is a bug. Note other issues in your return — don't fix them.

## TERP Conventions (Violations = QA Rejection)

| Pattern           | Rule                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | ----------------------- |
| Party Model       | Use `clients` table with `isSeller=true`, never `vendors`                    |
| Actor Attribution | Use `getAuthenticatedUserId(ctx)`, never `input.createdBy` or `input.userId` |
| Deletes           | Soft delete with `deletedAt`, never `DELETE FROM`                            |
| Types             | No `any` types. Use proper types or `unknown`                                |
| Errors            | Never swallow. Log and re-throw or handle explicitly                         |
| Default User ID   | Never use `ctx.user?.id                                                      |     | 1`or`ctx.user?.id ?? 1` |

## CI-Blocked Patterns (Auto-Reject)

These patterns will fail CI and block merging:

```typescript
// ❌ FORBIDDEN
ctx.user?.id || 1
ctx.user?.id ?? 1
input.createdBy
input.userId
db.query.vendors
: any
db.delete(
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Read the spec** provided in context thoroughly
2. **Think hard** about edge cases before coding
3. **If the task touches rendered UI and browser truth matters**, load the `terp-domscribe` skill and inspect the live runtime before editing.
4. **Create feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/[TASK_ID]-[short-slug]
   ```
5. **Implement** following TERP conventions
6. **For UI changes**, re-check the rendered result after the edit when local runtime truth is important.
7. **Run verification** (ALL must pass):
   ```bash
   pnpm check && pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build
   ```
8. **Commit** with conventional format:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "type(scope): description"
   ```

## Verification Commands

These are mandatory. Do not skip any:

| Command      | What It Checks         |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| `pnpm check` | TypeScript compilation |
| `pnpm lint`  | ESLint rules           |
| `pnpm test`  | Unit tests             |
| `pnpm build` | Production build       |

If any fail, **fix and re-run** until all pass.

## Autonomy Modes

Check the mode assigned to your task:

### 🟢 SAFE Mode

- Documentation, simple bug fixes, test additions
- Standard verification required

### 🟡 STRICT Mode (Default)

- New features, UI changes, business logic
- Full verification + explicit testing at each step

### 🔴 RED Mode

- Auth/RBAC, payments, accounting, migrations
- Requires rollback plan before starting
- Document every step taken

## Return Format (REQUIRED)

```
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
═══════════════════════

TASK: [ID]
BRANCH: [branch-name]
STATUS: READY_FOR_QA | BLOCKED

FILES MODIFIED:
- [path] (added/modified)
- [path] (added/modified)

VERIFICATION OUTPUT:
```

[exact terminal output of pnpm check && pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build]

```

SELF-ASSESSMENT:
Confident about:
- [list what you're sure is correct]

Uncertain about:
- [list anything you're not 100% sure of — be honest, QA will check]

Potential edge cases not fully tested:
- [list scenarios that might fail]

BLOCKERS (if any):
- [what's preventing completion]
```

## Forbidden Actions

- Do NOT expand scope beyond the task
- Do NOT merge or create PRs (orchestrator does this)
- Do NOT modify files outside the task's scope without documenting it
- Do NOT skip verification steps
- Do NOT return without passing verification output
- Do NOT use deprecated `vendors` table — use `clients` with `isSeller=true`
