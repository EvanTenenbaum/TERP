# 🎯 MVP Initiative - Primary Focus

**Status:** 🔴 ACTIVE  
**Document:** `docs/roadmaps/MVP_ROADMAP.md`

---

## ⚠️ MANDATORY FOR ALL AGENTS

**The MVP Roadmap is THE primary initiative for TERP.**

Before doing ANY work, you MUST:

1. **Read** `docs/roadmaps/MVP_ROADMAP.md`
2. **Check** current phase status
3. **Verify** your task is on the MVP roadmap

---

## Quick Reference

### Current Phase

Check `docs/roadmaps/MVP_ROADMAP.md` for current phase status.

### MVP Phases

1. ✅ Phase 0: Quick Wins (COMPLETE)
2. 🔄 Phase 1: Core UX (IN PROGRESS)
3. ⏳ Phase 2: Data Integrity
4. ⏳ Phase 3: Workflow Validation
5. ⏳ Phase 4: MVP Polish
6. ⏳ Phase 5: Nice-to-Haves

### When Asked to Define a Sprint

**ALWAYS** pull tasks from the current MVP phase:

```
1. Read docs/roadmaps/MVP_ROADMAP.md
2. Identify current phase
3. Select available tasks from that phase
4. Check for dependencies
5. Assign based on parallelization strategy
```

### When Asked for Roadmap Updates

**ALWAYS** update the MVP Roadmap:

```
1. Update task status in MVP_ROADMAP.md
2. Update phase progress percentage
3. Add status update entry to log
4. If phase complete, note checkpoint needed
```

### Deviation Protocol

If a task is NOT on the MVP roadmap:

1. **Ask:** Is this a critical production bug?
2. **Ask:** Does this unblock an MVP task?
3. **If NO to both:** Do NOT prioritize it
4. **If YES:** Get explicit user approval before proceeding
