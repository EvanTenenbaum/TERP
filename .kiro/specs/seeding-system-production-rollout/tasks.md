# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Phase 1: Production Environment Verification
  - [x] 1.1 Run dry-run test in production
    - Execute `pnpm seed:new --dry-run --size=small` via DigitalOcean console
    - Verify preview shows 7 tables with correct record counts
    - Confirm no errors in output
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_
  - [x] 1.2 Execute small seed test
    - Run `pnpm seed:new --clean --size=small --force` in production
    - Verify 195 records inserted (5 vendors, 10 clients, 20 products, 30 batches, 50 orders, 50 invoices, 30 payments)
    - Check for 0 errors in summary
    - _Requirements: 1.3, 4.1_
  - [ ] 1.3 Validate seeded data quality
    - Query each table to verify record counts match expected values
    - Verify FK references are valid (orders reference existing clients/batches)
    - Check PII masking audit shows masked fields
    - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3_
  - [ ] 1.4 Test application with seeded data
    - Navigate to production URL and verify pages load
    - Check Clients page shows seeded clients
    - Check Orders page shows seeded orders
    - Verify no console errors or loading failures
    - _Requirements: 4.4_

- [x] 2. Phase 2: Create Production Documentation
  - [x] 2.1 Create production seeding runbook
    - Created `docs/deployment/SEEDING_RUNBOOK.md`
    - Includes step-by-step instructions for production seeding
    - Documents DigitalOcean-specific commands and considerations
    - Added troubleshooting section with common errors
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_
  - [x] 2.2 Document rollback procedures
    - Added manual rollback SQL commands to runbook
    - Documented how to release stuck locks
    - Included data cleanup procedures
    - _Requirements: 3.3_
  - [x] 2.3 Document monitoring procedures
    - Added section on monitoring seeding progress
    - Documented how to verify success via logs
    - Included health check verification steps
    - _Requirements: 3.4_
  - [x] 2.4 Update seed README with production section
    - Production usage section already exists in `scripts/seed/README.md`
    - Environment-specific behavior documented
    - DigitalOcean deployment notes included
    - _Requirements: 3.1_

- [x] 3. Phase 3: Legacy Code Cleanup
  - [x] 3.1 Add deprecation warnings to SKIP_SEEDING
    - Updated `server/services/seedDefaults.ts` with @deprecated JSDoc and console warnings
    - Warnings point to `pnpm seed:new` and `docs/deployment/SEEDING_RUNBOOK.md`
    - Backward compatibility maintained
    - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2_
  - [x] 3.2 Archive legacy seeding scripts
    - `scripts/legacy/` directory already exists
    - `scripts/seed-realistic-main.ts` already moved to legacy folder
    - `scripts/seed-realistic-runner.ts` also archived
    - _Requirements: 5.3_
  - [x] 3.3 Update documentation references
    - `scripts/seed/README.md` updated with production section
    - `docs/deployment/SEEDING_RUNBOOK.md` created with new commands
    - Legacy references documented in README roadmap
    - _Requirements: 5.4_

- [ ] 4. Checkpoint - Verify all changes
  - Ensure all tests pass, ask the user if questions arise.

- [ ] 5. Property-Based Tests
  - [ ] 5.1 Write property test for PII masking completeness
    - **Property 1: PII Masking Completeness**
    - **Validates: Requirements 2.2**
    - Use fast-check to generate random records with PII fields
    - Verify all PII fields are masked in non-production
  - [ ] 5.2 Write property test for record count accuracy
    - **Property 2: Record Count Accuracy**
    - **Validates: Requirements 4.1**
    - Verify reported counts match actual database counts
  - [ ] 5.3 Write property test for referential integrity
    - **Property 3: Referential Integrity Preservation**
    - **Validates: Requirements 4.2**
    - Verify all FK references point to existing records

- [ ] 6. Final Checkpoint - Production validation complete
  - Ensure all tests pass, ask the user if questions arise.
