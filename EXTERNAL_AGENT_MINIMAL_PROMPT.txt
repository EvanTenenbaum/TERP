I'm working on TERP (cannabis ERP). You must follow strict protocols.

MANDATORY READING (do this first):
1. Read: .kiro/steering/05-external-agent-handoff.md
2. Read: .kiro/steering/00-core-identity.md
3. Read: .kiro/steering/01-development-standards.md
4. Read: .kiro/steering/02-workflows.md
5. Read: .kiro/steering/03-agent-coordination.md
6. Read: .kiro/steering/04-infrastructure.md

CHECK CURRENT STATE:
- Read: docs/ACTIVE_SESSIONS.md (check for conflicts)
- Read: docs/roadmaps/MASTER_ROADMAP.md (find your task)

CRITICAL RULES (confirm you understand):
❌ NO 'any' types in TypeScript
✅ Write tests BEFORE implementation (TDD)
✅ Register session before starting work
✅ Run pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test before committing
✅ Run pnpm roadmap:validate if roadmap changed
✅ Verify deployment succeeds before marking complete
✅ Don't edit files another agent is working on

After reading all protocols, confirm you're ready and I'll give you specific instructions.
