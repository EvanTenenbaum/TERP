## Known Limitations

1. **Template UI:** Backend infrastructure complete, but UI for template management not yet implemented
2. **Column Visibility:** Schema supports column configuration, but UI toggle not yet built
3. **History View:** Save functionality works, but dedicated history viewing page not yet created
4. **Batch Integration:** Currently uses basic batch fields; could be enhanced with product/lot relationships

---

## Future Enhancement Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Template Management UI** - Add page for creating/managing templates
2. **History Dashboard** - Dedicated page to view and reload past sales sheets
3. **Email Integration** - Send sales sheets directly to clients

### Medium Priority
4. **Advanced Filtering** - More sophisticated inventory filtering
5. **Bulk Operations** - Select multiple items with advanced criteria
6. **Price History** - Track price changes over time for analytics

### Low Priority
7. **Mobile App** - Native mobile app for on-the-go sales sheet creation
8. **Analytics Dashboard** - Track usage patterns and pricing trends
9. **Client Notifications** - Alert clients when new sales sheets are available

---

## Testing Recommendations

### User Acceptance Testing
1. Create sample pricing rules for different scenarios
2. Create pricing profiles for different client types
3. Apply profiles to test clients
4. Create sales sheets with various items
5. Test all export formats
6. Verify price calculations are accurate

### Performance Testing
1. Test with large inventory datasets (1000+ items)
2. Monitor query performance for pricing calculations
3. Test drag-and-drop with many items (50+)
4. Verify export performance for large sales sheets

### Edge Case Testing
1. Test with clients that have no pricing rules
2. Test with items that match multiple rules
3. Test price overrides with extreme values
4. Test export with empty sales sheets
5. Test concurrent editing by multiple users

## Support & Maintenance

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** Pricing not calculating correctly
- **Solution:** Check that client has pricing profile or rules applied
- **Verify:** Client profile > Pricing tab shows active rules

**Issue:** Items not appearing in inventory browser

**Issue:** Export not working
- **Solution:** Check browser console for errors
- **Verify:** Required libraries (html2canvas, jspdf) are loaded

### Monitoring Recommendations
1. Track pricing calculation performance
2. Monitor export success rates
3. Track most-used pricing rules
4. Monitor sales sheet creation frequency
5. Track user adoption of features
