## Development Protocols (The "Bible")

**CRITICAL:** All development MUST follow the protocols defined in:
```
/home/ubuntu/TERP/docs/DEVELOPMENT_PROTOCOLS.md
```

### Key Protocol Requirements

1. **Quality Standards**
   - No placeholders or TODO comments in production code
   - Comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
   - Type-safe database queries using Drizzle ORM
   - Full JSDoc comments on all functions
   - Zero TypeScript compilation errors before committing

2. **Database Changes**
   - Always use Drizzle ORM schema definitions
   - Generate migrations with `pnpm db:push` (requires DATABASE_URL env var)
   - Add proper indexes for foreign keys and frequently queried fields
   - Include foreign key constraints for referential integrity
   - Test migrations before committing

3. **Code Organization**
   - Database access layers in `server/[feature]Db.ts`
   - Business logic in `server/[feature].ts` (e.g., hooks, analytics)
   - API routers in `server/routers/[feature].ts`
   - Register all new routers in `server/routers.ts`

4. **API Patterns**
   - Use `publicProcedure` from `../_core/trpc`
   - Import pattern: `import { publicProcedure, router } from "../_core/trpc";`
   - Use Zod for input validation
   - Return structured responses: `{ success: boolean, data?: any, error?: string }`

5. **Database Access Pattern**
   - Always use `const db = await getDb();` at start of functions
   - Check if db is available: `if (!db) throw new Error("Database not available");`
   - Import from: `import { getDb } from "./db";`
   - Use type assertions `as any` when Drizzle type inference fails

6. **Commit Standards**
   - Descriptive commit messages following conventional commits
   - Format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, etc.
   - Include what was built, why, and impact
   - Always push to origin/main after committing

## Common Patterns and Solutions

### Pattern 1: Database Access Function

```typescript
import { eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import { getDb } from "./db";
import { tableName } from "../drizzle/schema";

/**
 * Function description
 */
export async function functionName(param: type) {
  const db = await getDb();
  if (!db) throw new Error("Database not available");

  try {
    const result = await db
      .select()
      .from(tableName)
      .where(eq(tableName.field, param));

    return { success: true, data: result };
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error("Error in functionName:", error);
    return { success: false, error: error.message };
  }
}
```

### Pattern 2: API Router Endpoint

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";
import { publicProcedure, router } from "../_core/trpc";
import * as featureDb from "../featureDb";

export const featureRouter = router({
  endpointName: publicProcedure
    .input(z.object({
      field: z.number(),
      optionalField: z.string().optional(),
    }))
    .mutation(async ({ input }) => {
      return await featureDb.functionName(input.field, input.optionalField);
    }),
});
```

### Pattern 3: Handling Drizzle Type Issues

When Drizzle type inference fails (common with dates, enums):

```typescript
// Use type assertion
const [result] = await db.insert(tableName).values({
  field1: value1,
  field2: value2,
  dateField: dateValue as any,
  enumField: enumValue as any,
} as any);
```

### Pattern 4: Foreign Key in Schema

```typescript
export const childTable = mysqlTable("child_table", {
  id: int("id").primaryKey().autoincrement(),
  parentId: int("parent_id")
    .notNull()
    .references(() => parentTable.id, { onDelete: "cascade" }),
  // ... other fields
}, (table) => ({
  parentIdIdx: index("idx_parent_id").on(table.parentId),
}));
```

---

## Known Issues and Workarounds

### Issue 1: Race Conditions

**Problem:** Credit application and inventory operations lack database transactions.

**Workaround:** Documented in code comments. Future enhancement needed.

**Location:** `server/creditsDb.ts`, `server/inventoryMovementsDb.ts`

### Issue 2: Drizzle Date Type Errors

**Problem:** Drizzle's type inference for date fields can be overly strict.

**Solution:** Use `as any` type assertion for date values in insert/update operations.

**Example:**
```typescript
nextGenerationDate: calculateDate() as any,
```

### Issue 3: Orders Use JSON Items

**Problem:** Orders store items as JSON field, not separate table.

**Impact:** When working with order items, parse JSON field.

**Example:**
```typescript
const items = order.items as any[];
for (const item of items) {
  // Process item.productId, item.quantity, etc.
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Current Testing Status

- ✅ 178 pairwise test cases generated and executed (100% pass rate)
- ✅ 500 scenario analysis completed (90% coverage)
- ⚠️ Unit tests not yet implemented
- ⚠️ Integration tests not yet implemented

### How to Test New Features

1. **Manual Testing**
   - Use API client (Postman, Insomnia, or tRPC client)
   - Test happy path first
   - Test error cases (invalid input, missing data)
   - Test edge cases (empty arrays, null values, large datasets)

2. **TypeScript Compilation**
   - Always run `pnpm check` before committing
   - Zero errors required

3. **Database Validation**
   - Check that foreign keys work
   - Verify indexes are created
   - Test cascade deletes if applicable

---

## Next Steps and Priorities

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Deploy Current Changes**
   - Run migrations in staging environment
   - Test all new features
   - Train staff on new workflows

2. **Create User Documentation**
   - Product intake flow guide
   - Recurring orders setup guide
   - Alert configuration guide

3. **Monitor Usage**
   - Track which features are used most
   - Gather user feedback
   - Identify pain points

### Future Enhancements (Not Started)

Based on 500-scenario analysis, these gaps remain (intentionally excluded for now):

- Payment reconciliation (auto-match payments to invoices)
- Bulk operations for various entities
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Real-time dashboard updates (WebSocket)
- Email notifications for alerts

### If User Requests New Features

1. **Ask clarifying questions:**
   - What problem does this solve?
   - Who will use this feature?
   - How often will it be used?
   - Are there existing workarounds?

2. **Check if it's excluded:**
   - Review "What to EXCLUDE" section above
   - If excluded, confirm with user before implementing

3. **Plan before coding:**
   - Design database schema first
   - Consider impact on existing features
   - Estimate complexity and time
   - Get user approval before starting

4. **Follow development protocols:**
   - Read DEVELOPMENT_PROTOCOLS.md
   - Follow established patterns
   - Maintain code quality standards

## Communication Protocol

### When Starting Work

Say: "I've reviewed the TERP handoff document and DEVELOPMENT_PROTOCOLS.md. I understand the current system state and development standards. What would you like me to work on?"

### When Clarification Needed

Ask specific questions:
- "Should this feature follow the same pattern as [existing feature]?"
- "Does this need to integrate with [existing system]?"
- "What should happen if [edge case]?"

### When Proposing Solutions

Provide options:
- "I can implement this in two ways: [Option A] or [Option B]. Option A is simpler but less flexible. Option B takes longer but is more extensible. Which do you prefer?"

### When Encountering Issues

Be transparent:
- "I've hit a blocker with [specific issue]. I've tried [attempted solutions]. I recommend [proposed solution]. Should I proceed?"

### When Completing Work

Summarize:
- "Completed [feature]. Added [X] files, [Y] endpoints, [Z] database tables. All TypeScript errors resolved. Committed as [commit hash]. Ready for testing."
