**Agent:** Manus AI
**Started:** 2025-11-14
**Status:** Complete - Investigation

## Progress

- [x] Phase 1: Pre-flight check complete
- [x] Phase 2: Implementation complete (Investigation - No fix required)
- [x] Phase 3: Testing complete (Already covered by QA-013 test suite)
- [x] Phase 4: Roadmap updated and pushed

## Notes

### Investigation Summary

Confirmed that the History button works correctly as a view mode switcher, identical to the Analytics button (QA-013). No actual 404 errors exist.

### Key Findings

1. History button uses `onClick={() => setViewMode("history")}` - correct implementation
2. WorkflowHistory component exists and is fully functional
3. tRPC endpoint `getRecentChanges` is properly implemented
4. Test coverage already exists from QA-013

### Conclusion

The reported issue does not exist in the current codebase. Recommend marking as "Cannot Reproduce" or "Already Fixed".
