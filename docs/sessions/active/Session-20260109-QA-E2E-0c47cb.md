## Progress

- [x] Phase 0: Register session + review existing QA artifacts
- [ ] Phase 1: Create credentials for missing roles
- [ ] Phase 2: Execute remaining role-based UI entry paths
- [ ] Phase 3: Update coverage + defect logs

## Notes

- Continuing E2E browser coverage blocked by missing role credentials.
- Added seed:test-accounts mappings for missing matrix roles; credentials still need seeding in target env.
