# QA-031: Fix Settings Icon Responsiveness

**Session ID:** Session-20251114-QA-031-3b7bfbb9
**Task ID:** QA-031
**Priority:** P0
**Started:** 2025-11-14 15:30:00
**Completed:** 2025-11-14 15:45:00
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Branch:** qa-031-fix
**Commit:** 4325b4c

## Task Description

The "Settings" icon in the main navigation is unresponsive and does not trigger any action.

## Resolution

Added onClick handler to Settings button in `client/src/components/layout/AppHeader.tsx` to navigate to `/settings` route. Also added title attribute for accessibility. The settings route already existed in App.tsx, so only the button handler was needed.
