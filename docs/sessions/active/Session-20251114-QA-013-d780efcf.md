## Notes

### Investigation Summary

After comprehensive code analysis, determined that the Analytics and History features are correctly implemented as view mode switchers within the WorkflowQueuePage component. No actual 404 errors exist in the current codebase.

### Key Findings

1. Analytics button uses `onClick={() => setViewMode("analytics")}` - correct implementation
2. History button uses `onClick={() => setViewMode("history")}` - correct implementation
3. WorkflowAnalytics and WorkflowHistory components exist and are fully functional
4. All necessary tRPC endpoints are properly implemented
5. Routing configuration is correct

### Changes Made

1. Created comprehensive test suite: `client/src/pages/WorkflowQueuePage.test.tsx`
2. Created detailed completion report: `docs/QA-013-COMPLETION-REPORT.md`

### Conclusion

The reported issue does not exist in the current codebase. Recommend marking as "Cannot Reproduce" or "Already Fixed".
