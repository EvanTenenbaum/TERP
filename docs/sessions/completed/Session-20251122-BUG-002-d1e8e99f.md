## Notes

**Root Cause Identified:**
- `AppShell` component renders `AppSidebar` (old navigation menu)
- `DashboardV3` uses `DashboardLayout` which has its own sidebar navigation
- Both are being rendered simultaneously, causing duplicate navigation bar

**Fix Strategy:**
- Remove `AppSidebar` rendering from `AppShell` for pages that use `DashboardLayout`
- Since `DashboardLayout` is the new standard, we should conditionally render `AppSidebar` only for pages that don't use `DashboardLayout`
- Alternative: Remove `AppSidebar` entirely if all pages use `DashboardLayout`

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx` - Added conditional rendering to skip AppSidebar for dashboard routes

**Solution Implemented:**
- Modified `AppShell` to check if current route is "/" or "/dashboard"
- Conditionally render `AppSidebar` and `AppHeader` only for non-dashboard routes
- Dashboard routes now exclusively use `DashboardLayout`'s sidebar navigation
- No duplicate navigation bars appear

**Commit:** `549aaa57` - Fix BUG-002: Remove duplicate navigation bar from dashboard

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
