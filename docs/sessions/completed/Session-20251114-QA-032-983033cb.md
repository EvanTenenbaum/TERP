# QA-032: Fix User Profile Icon Responsiveness

**Session ID:** Session-20251114-QA-032-983033cb
**Task ID:** QA-032
**Priority:** P0
**Started:** 2025-11-14 15:50:00
**Completed:** 2025-11-14 15:50:00
**Status:** ✅ Complete (Fixed with QA-031)
**Branch:** qa-032-fix (no changes needed)
**Related Commit:** 4325b4c (from QA-031)

## Task Description

The user profile icon in the main navigation is also unresponsive.

## Resolution

This issue was already fixed as part of QA-031. When fixing the Settings icon, I also added the onClick handler to the User Profile button in `client/src/components/layout/AppHeader.tsx`. Both icons now navigate to `/settings` route and have title attributes for accessibility.

The Settings page includes user management features (Users tab), so having both icons navigate to the same page is appropriate.

## Notes

- QA-031 and QA-032 were both navigation icon responsiveness issues
- Fixed together in a single commit (4325b4c)
- Both icons now navigate to /settings which includes user management
- This is a common UX pattern where user profile settings are part of main settings
