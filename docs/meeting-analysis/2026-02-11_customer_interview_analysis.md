    *   `[01:28.6 - 01:58.6]` "New sale should take you to this..."

    *   `[04:02.5 - 04:24.0]` "Basically all of these things, stock, price, it should be a price range..."
    *   `[04:24.0 - 04:36.2]` "...when I click here, it should select the whole thing, I don't want to have to just click in here."
    *   `[04:36.2 - 05:03.5]` "This should add by whole units, when I click up, not by points..."
    *   `[05:03.5 - 05:24.9]` "There should be an ability to, maybe right here, quickly hide margin."
    *   `[07:23.3 - 07:31.8]` "This should automatically default to dollar, not percent, and I should be able to select between the two."
    *   `[07:32.8 - 07:55.8]` "I should be able to quickly clear it too."
    *   `[10:19.0 - 10:28.0]` "This should have a save button of some sort."
    *   `[12:13.8 - 12:26.8]` "...the line items should be on the right, everything else underneath in the line items should be small enough that the main section is this basically."
    *   `[12:43.8 - 13:09.8]` "You should be able to undo this, edit it, whatever."
    *   `[16:17.8 - 16:22.8]` "You should be able to go back and edit the sales."
    *   `[16:48.8 - 16:56.8]` "You should also be able to click into a distribution here as well as edit this in line."
    *   `[16:56.8 - 17:18.8]` "...change this to like percentage by order, dollar value per order or a dollar value per unit sold."
    *   `[17:37.8 - 17:50.8]` "...this needs to have the same standardized, much better filtering across everything that has browsing like this."
    *   `[18:27.8 - 18:48.8]` "Same with sales too, you immediately pull up their pricing rules to change what the retail price is that it's showing here."
*   **Intake:**
    *   `[25:55.0 - 26:04.0]` "I also need the ability to create a new vendor or a new farmer."
    *   `[26:50.0 - 27:05.2]` "This needs to basically, this and add batch need to be consolidated into one thing."
    *   `[28:21.2 - 28:39.2]` "There just needs to be an intake button, basically."
    *   `[29:19.2 - 29:34.2]` "I want this to be able to just happen super fast, and it should be both the drop down and typing, drop down and typing, drop down and typing."
    *   `[29:34.2 - 29:42.2]` "Strain and product name need to be combined into one thing."
    *   `[29:42.2 - 30:04.2]` "If the strain validation finds a strain, there should be a way of basically saying, hey, does this look right? The user can quickly, quickly, yes or no, create a new strain or new product."
    *   `[30:04.2 - 30:12.2]` "It should allow for creating a new strain, basically."
    *   `[31:18.2 - 31:23.2]` "I want to be able to tab it in the next one."

#### Business Rules

*   `[08:25.8 - 09:03.0]` "...there should never be a product that has, that is the exact same product name between two batches."
*   `[09:03.0 - 09:27.0]` "It should always default to FIFO."
*   `[18:27.8 - 18:48.8]` "...client should automatically pull up their pricing rules."
*   `[19:08.8 - 19:13.8]` "Both should be set automatically with the pricing rules by the customer."
*   `[28:45.2 - 28:58.2]` "There's never going to be a time where a product is added unless it's part of a batch period."
*   `[31:23.2 - 31:27.2]` "This should always default to consignment."
*   `[31:27.2 - 31:32.2]` "It should always default to main warehouse."

#### Bugs & Broken Flows

*   `[02:23.7 - 02:31.4]` "...first of all, there should be orders here because there's other data through the system, let's figure out whether that's just something wonky with the data seeding or whether there's actually a wiring issue with the data."
*   `[07:31.8 - 07:32.8]` "Doesn't work right now."
*   `[10:30.0 - 10:32.0]` "When I click markup, it closes everything. Yeah."
*   `[11:44.8 - 11:54.8]` "Didn't really change anything related to the estimated profit I think, there's some sort of calculation wonkiness happening there."
*   `[13:09.8 - 13:12.8]` "Oh, that didn't work."
*   `[13:26.8 - 13:28.8]` "That didn't work either."
*   `[13:36.8 - 13:37.8]` "That didn't work either."
*   `[14:46.8 - 14:52.8]` "This is also not correct, saving it as a quote should not finalize it as an order."
*   `[16:38.8 - 16:40.8]` "All right, that doesn't work."
*   `[22:23.9 - 22:31.9]` "That doesn't work."
*   `[23:18.3 - 23:21.3]` "That didn't work."
*   `[27:22.2 - 27:28.2]` "That seems to be a bug."
*   `[27:33.2 - 27:34.2]` "Doesn't work."
*   `[27:36.2 - 27:38.2]` "In the hot input. Okay. That's an issue."
*   `[31:08.2 - 31:18.2]` "Okay, that needs to work."
*   `[31:32.2 - 31:47.2]` "That should work."

#### UX/UI Feedback

*   `[05:24.9 - 05:52.9]` "There's too many things going on right here."
*   `[06:24.9 - 06:54.4]` "Then we should have this below here along with order preview under this, which should be automatically minimized, but then if they want, you should be able to expand it."
*   `[06:54.4 - 07:23.3]` "If this truly is order preview, the customer should definitely not be seeing any margin here, or estimated profit."
*   `[10:52.8 - 11:13.8]` "...they definitely should not be seeing any sort of information about the markups or a spending profit."
*   `[12:04.8 - 12:08.8]` "I need to be able to hide the sidebar to get a bigger view of this."
*   `[12:13.8 - 12:26.8]` "...the line items should be on the right, everything else underneath in the line items should be small enough that the main section is this basically."
*   `[19:26.8 - 19:55.8]` "The quick view, the draft shouldn't be exactly what's added here, but rather the filter types that are set so that, you know, this might change."
*   `[21:13.7 - 21:43.2]` "So, this should actually just be showing what's available. Right now it's showing kind of as a draft order, but the sales sheet is more like, okay, show me what you have in stock, how much of it you have."
*   `[28:58.2 - 29:10.2]` "If we need this on the back end or something, that's fine, but the user doesn't really need to see it because they should just be basically working from inventory."

#### Decisions Made

*   `[14:00.8 - 14:12.8]` "No, let's get rid of the idea of quote and instead just have a sales draft. Or no, nevermind, take that back."
*   `[15:22.8 - 15:47.8]` "Let's just simplify it and have it basically just be sale."
*   `[15:52.8 - 16:17.8]` "It should just be a quote. Everything created here is a quote until you click confirm and that is when it turns into an actual sale."
*   `[16:25.8 - 16:33.8]` "Let's get rid of like sales, a sale draft instead. Quote should just take that place."
*   `[24:48.0 - 24:53.0]` "So orders need to be sales. Quotes just need to be within sales. Simple."
*   `[28:39.2 - 28:45.2]` "I'm going to get rid of this concept of these two things being super different."

#### Developer Framing

*   The entire interview is from the perspective of the 'Dev' persona, who is guiding the feedback and making decisions about the product direction.

#### Unresolved Threads

*   `[14:30.8 - 14:34.8]` "I don't really know what the next page is so we need to sort that out."
*   `[27:28.2 - 27:33.2]` "Figure out where these notes are saved."

#### Implied Business Context

*   The business is a cannabis distributor, dealing with vendors/farmers and clients/dispensaries.
*   The business operates on a consignment model in some cases.
*   The business has a need for robust inventory management, including batch tracking, aging, and FIFO.
*   The business has complex pricing rules that vary by customer.

#### Personal Details

## Part 3: UX/UI Design Recommendations

### Core Design Principles (derived from customer feedback)

*   **Efficiency First:** The primary goal of the UI should be to enable users to complete tasks as quickly and with as few clicks as possible. This means prioritizing keyboard shortcuts, inline editing, and streamlined workflows over visually complex or multi-step processes.
*   **Clarity and Consistency:** The language and design patterns used throughout the application should be consistent and unambiguous. This includes consistent terminology (e.g., "Sales" instead of "Orders"), predictable placement of UI elements, and clear visual hierarchy.
*   **Information on Demand:** While the user wants access to a lot of data, it should be presented in a way that is not overwhelming. This means using techniques like progressive disclosure (e.g., expandable sections, modals for detailed views) and allowing the user to customize the information they see (e.g., hiding margin information).
*   **Empower the User:** The application should empower users to make their own decisions by providing them with clear, accurate, and actionable data. The UI should not attempt to make decisions for the user or hide information that could be relevant to their workflow.

### Specific Layout/Naming/Simplification Recommendations

*   **Layout:**
    *   Implement a persistent sidebar with quick links to the most frequently used sections of the application (Dashboard, New Sale, New Intake, Clients).
    *   Allow the user to collapse the sidebar to maximize the content area.
    *   In the sales view, consider moving the line items to a more prominent position (e.g., a right-hand panel) to keep them in view while browsing products.
    *   The order preview should be automatically minimized to reduce visual clutter, with the option to expand it for more detail.

*   **Naming:**
    *   Standardize on the term "Sales" instead of "Orders" throughout the application.
    *   Simplify the concept of "Quotes" and "Sale Drafts" into a single "Quote" entity that can be converted into a sale.

*   **Simplification:**
    *   Consolidate the "Add Product" and "Add Batch" workflows into a single, streamlined intake process.
    *   Remove the "Comments" feature, as it is not being used and adds unnecessary complexity.
    *   Implement a "smart search" feature that provides more relevant and powerful search capabilities.
    *   Enable inline editing for key fields like quantity and order limit to reduce the need for modal dialogs.

### What NOT to Build

*   **AI/Recommendation Engines:** The user has explicitly stated that they do not want the system to make decisions for them. Avoid features like "Focus Items," "Needs Attention" badges, or any other system-generated priorities.
*   **Unnecessary Clicks:** Any feature that adds extra steps or clicks to a core workflow should be carefully evaluated and likely avoided.
*   **Overly Complex UI:** The UI should be as simple and intuitive as possible. Avoid adding features or UI elements that are not essential to the user's workflow.

## Part 4: Open Questions

### Unresolved threads and ambiguities needing follow-up

*   **Next Page after Quote/Sale Creation:** The speaker was unsure about the page that should be displayed after creating a quote or sale. This needs to be defined to ensure a seamless user flow. `[14:30.8 - 14:34.8]` "I don't really know what the next page is so we need to sort that out."
*   **Location of Saved Notes:** The speaker was unsure where notes are being saved in the system. This needs to be investigated to ensure that notes are being stored and can be retrieved when needed. `[27:28.2 - 27:33.2]` "Figure out where these notes are saved."

```
[00:00.0 - 00:15.8] Dev: Okay, so first off, this doesn't actually search anything, this just takes us to search
[00:15.8 - 00:30.8] Dev: this, it needs to be the same power as, or this needs to have the same power as this.
[00:30.8 - 00:38.6] Dev: Get rid of comments, both for dashboard and anywhere else, it needs to be completely removed
[00:38.6 - 00:50.3] Dev: from the system.
[00:50.3 - 01:04.7] Dev: This sidebar should have above the sales, inventory, all the buckets, should just have
[01:04.7 - 01:09.7] Dev: some quick links that are always visible.
[01:09.7 - 01:25.1] Dev: One should be dashboard, two should be new sale, three should be new intake, four should
[01:25.1 - 01:28.6] Dev: be clients.
[01:28.6 - 01:58.6] Dev: New sale should take you to this, I guess, mm-hmm, no, this is for intake, nevermind,
[01:58.6 - 02:06.4] Dev: this is for sales.
[02:06.4 - 02:23.7] Dev: So orders needs to get changed to sales, all the terminology, and order is actually a sale.
[02:23.7 - 02:27.0] Dev: So let's dig into just this, first of all, there should be orders here because there's
[02:27.0 - 02:31.4] Dev: other data through the system, let's figure out whether that's just something wonky with
[02:31.4 - 02:46.0] Dev: the data seeding or whether there's actually a wiring issue with the data.
[02:46.0 - 03:10.0] Dev: The quick new sale should just bump immediately to here.
[03:10.0 - 03:25.0] Dev: This needs to be editable in line right here in terms of how much they're getting.
[03:25.0 - 03:37.2] Dev: Order limit needs to be quickly editable from here.
[03:37.2 - 04:02.5] Dev: Category needs to have quick filters for category slash subcategory.
[04:02.5 - 04:24.0] Dev: Basically all of these things, stock, price, it should be a price range, okay, when I
[04:24.0 - 04:36.2] Dev: click here, it should select the whole thing, I don't want to have to just click in here.
[04:36.2 - 05:03.5] Dev: This should add by whole units, when I click up, not by points, great.
[05:03.5 - 05:24.9] Dev: There should be an ability to, maybe right here, quickly hide margin.
[05:24.9 - 05:52.9] Dev: This is doubled up, so actually we just won't, I want ... There's too many things going on
[06:23.9 - 06:24.9] Dev: right here.
[06:24.9 - 06:44.8] Dev: Then we should have this below here along with order preview under this, which should
[06:44.8 - 06:54.4] Dev: be automatically minimized, but then if they want, you should be able to expand it.
[06:54.4 - 06:58.2] Dev: If this truly is order preview, the customer should definitely not be seeing any margin
[06:58.2 - 07:23.3] Dev: here, or estimated profit.
[07:23.3 - 07:30.8] Dev: This should automatically default to dollar, not percent, and I should be able to select
[07:30.8 - 07:31.8] Dev: between the two.
[07:31.8 - 07:32.8] Dev: Doesn't work right now.
[07:32.8 - 07:55.8] Dev: I should be able to quickly clear it too.
[08:25.8 - 08:43.6] Dev: Probably possible, because there should never be a product that has, that is the exact same
[08:43.6 - 09:03.0] Dev: product name between two batches.
[09:03.0 - 09:27.0] Dev: It should always default to FIFO.
[09:57.0 - 10:16.0] Dev: Okay.
[10:16.0 - 10:17.0] Dev: Seems like ...
[10:18.0 - 10:19.0] Dev: Okay.
[10:19.0 - 10:28.0] Dev: This should have a save button of some sort.
[10:28.0 - 10:29.0] Dev: Okay.
[10:29.0 - 10:30.0] Dev: That's also a bug.
[10:30.0 - 10:31.0] Dev: When I click markup, it closes everything.
[10:31.0 - 10:32.0] Dev: Yeah.
[10:36.8 - 10:52.8] Dev: I like that this is floating though, that's cool.
[10:52.8 - 11:05.8] Dev: AI again, this is what they're going to see, they definitely should not be able to see
[11:05.8 - 11:12.8] Dev: they definitely should not be seeing any sort of information about the markups or a spending
[11:12.8 - 11:13.8] Dev: profit.
[11:13.8 - 11:15.8] Dev: profit.
[11:44.8 - 11:54.8] Dev: Didn't really change anything related to the estimated profit I think, there's some sort of calculation wonkiness happening there.
[12:04.8 - 12:08.8] Dev: I need to be able to hide the sidebar to get a bigger view of this.
[12:13.8 - 12:26.8] Dev: So yeah again, the line items should be on the right, everything else underneath in the line items should be small enough that the main section is this basically.
[12:43.8 - 13:09.8] Dev: You should be able to undo this, edit it, whatever.
[13:09.8 - 13:12.8] Dev: Oh, that didn't work.
[13:12.8 - 13:14.8] Dev: That needs to get fixed.
[13:26.8 - 13:28.8] Dev: That didn't work either.
[13:36.8 - 13:37.8] Dev: That didn't work either.
[13:40.8 - 13:59.8] Dev: I think everything created here basically should just be treated as a quote.
[14:00.8 - 14:08.8] Dev: No, let's get rid of the idea of quote and instead just have a sales draft.
[14:08.8 - 14:12.8] Dev: Or no, nevermind, take that back.
[14:22.8 - 14:23.8] Dev: Yeah.
[14:30.8 - 14:34.8] Dev: I don't really know what the next page is so we need to sort that out.
[14:46.8 - 14:52.8] Dev: This is also not correct, saving it as a quote should not finalize it as an order.
[14:52.8 - 15:14.8] Dev: It should go, let's see, create this and you can either save it as a quote.
[15:22.8 - 15:47.8] Dev: Let's just simplify it and have it basically just be sale.
[15:52.8 - 16:03.8] Dev: It should just be a quote.
[16:03.8 - 16:17.8] Dev: Everything created here is a quote until you click confirm and that is when it turns into an actual sale.
[16:17.8 - 16:22.8] Dev: You should be able to go back and edit the sales.
[16:22.8 - 16:25.8] Dev: Quotes you can save.
[16:25.8 - 16:31.8] Dev: Let's get rid of like sales, a sale draft instead.
[16:31.8 - 16:33.8] Dev: Quote should just take that place.
[16:38.8 - 16:40.8] Dev: All right, that doesn't work.
[16:42.8 - 16:44.8] Dev: We need to fix that.
[16:48.8 - 16:56.8] Dev: You should also be able to click into a distribution here as well as edit this in line.
[16:56.8 - 17:18.8] Dev: Or yeah, change this to like percentage by order, dollar value per order or a dollar value per unit sold.
[17:27.8 - 17:31.8] Dev: Sale sheet.
[17:37.8 - 17:50.8] Dev: Again, this needs to have the same standardized, much better filtering across everything that has browsing like this.
[17:56.8 - 18:25.8] Dev: Okay, so this should, client should automatically pull up their pricing rules.
[18:27.8 - 18:48.8] Dev: Same with sales too, you immediately pull up their pricing rules to change what the retail price is that it's showing here.
[18:48.8 - 18:54.8] Dev: Okay, so you can do it like that, but that's, yeah, wonky.
[18:55.8 - 19:08.8] Dev: Um, yeah, that needs to get sorted out so we can basically change the markup.
[19:08.8 - 19:13.8] Dev: Both should be set automatically with the pricing rules by the customer.
[19:19.8 - 19:21.8] Dev: That's cool.
[19:24.8 - 19:26.8] Dev: Hmm.
[19:26.8 - 19:55.8] Dev: The quick view, the draft shouldn't be exactly what's added here, but rather the filter types that are set so that, you know, this might change.
[19:56.8 - 20:04.8] Dev: Based on what's in inventory, but really the goal is like, okay, we have QA contact, Q4, F9, the client.
[20:04.8 - 20:17.8] Dev: And we know that she likes, um, indoor from a certain vendor price between $800 and $1,000 a unit.
[20:18.8 - 20:31.8] Dev: And I want to be able to kind of save that view as a draft or yeah, as a quick view and have that pop up instead of this.
[20:31.8 - 20:33.8] Dev: That's what's happening here.
[20:47.8 - 20:48.8] Dev: Okay.
[21:13.7 - 21:32.0] Dev: So, this should actually just be showing what's available.
[21:32.0 - 21:35.2] Dev: Right now it's showing kind of as a draft order, but the sales sheet is more like, okay,
[21:35.2 - 21:43.2] Dev: show me what you have in stock, how much of it you have.
[21:43.2 - 21:59.1] Dev: And so, yeah, it should be product name, vendor, retail price per unit based on the
[21:59.1 - 22:14.9] Dev: customer's rule-based pricing or edited in line or on an overall sales sheet perspective.
[22:14.9 - 22:21.9] Dev: And then, how many are available?
[22:21.9 - 22:23.9] Dev: Yeah.
[22:23.9 - 22:31.9] Dev: That doesn't work.
[22:31.9 - 22:43.2] Dev: That needs to work.
[22:43.2 - 22:50.7] Dev: So if that does convert to an order, what it should be doing is just popping up, and
[22:50.7 - 22:59.4] Dev: it should be convert to quote, yeah.
[22:59.4 - 23:10.3] Dev: And then the quote that comes up should require number of units and a lot for all of the price
[23:10.3 - 23:17.3] Dev: editing, et cetera, that we're talking about.
[23:17.3 - 23:18.3] Dev: Okay.
[23:18.3 - 23:21.3] Dev: That didn't work.
[23:21.3 - 23:22.3] Dev: Wow.
[23:22.3 - 23:25.3] Dev: It really worked.
[23:25.3 - 23:28.3] Dev: That's amazing.
[23:28.3 - 23:29.3] Dev: Okay.
[23:29.3 - 23:53.0] Dev: So, again, what we want is item name, vendor, category, quantity available, and then price
[23:53.0 - 23:54.0] Dev: per unit.
[23:54.0 - 23:55.0] Dev: That's good.
[23:56.0 - 24:02.0] Dev: We don't need total value here.
[24:02.0 - 24:08.0] Dev: That's good.
[24:08.0 - 24:14.0] Dev: I think.
[24:14.0 - 24:18.0] Dev: Okay.
[24:19.0 - 24:46.0] Dev: And then to mark, it's not for right now, but that's important.
[24:46.0 - 24:48.0] Dev: This just needs to get consolidated.
[24:48.0 - 24:50.0] Dev: So orders need to be sales.
[24:50.0 - 24:53.0] Dev: Quotes just need to be within sales.
[24:53.0 - 24:54.0] Dev: Simple.
[24:54.0 - 24:55.0] Dev: Yeah.
[24:55.0 - 24:56.0] Dev: Now we're back here.
[24:56.0 - 24:57.0] Dev: Okay.
[24:58.0 - 25:07.0] Dev: All right.
[25:07.0 - 25:12.0] Dev: So.
[25:13.0 - 25:40.0] Dev: I think we need to get clear here on.
[25:41.0 - 25:42.0] Dev: I need to be able to search in here.
[25:42.0 - 25:45.0] Dev: Also, I want multiple rows already here.
[25:45.0 - 25:55.0] Dev: I need to be able to, this needs to be like a smart search almost.
[25:55.0 - 26:04.0] Dev: I also need the ability to create a new vendor or a new farmer.
[26:04.0 - 26:28.0] Dev: Really any of these.
[26:29.0 - 26:36.0] Dev: This should always default to assignment.
[26:36.0 - 26:40.0] Dev: Nice.
[26:40.0 - 26:50.0] Dev: This is cool.
[26:50.0 - 27:05.2] Dev: This needs to basically, this and add batch need to be consolidated into one thing.
[27:05.2 - 27:22.2] Dev: This one should always just default to main.
[27:22.2 - 27:28.2] Dev: That seems to be a bug.
[27:28.2 - 27:33.2] Dev: Figure out where these notes are saved.
[27:33.2 - 27:34.2] Dev: Doesn't work.
[27:34.2 - 27:35.2] Dev: Oh, it does.
[27:35.2 - 27:36.2] Dev: Okay.
[27:36.2 - 27:37.2] Dev: In the hot input.
[27:37.2 - 27:38.2] Dev: Okay.
[27:38.2 - 27:39.2] Dev: That's an issue.
[27:39.2 - 28:05.2] Dev: Yeah, there's all sorts of stuff here that needs to get.
[28:06.2 - 28:15.2] Dev: Yeah.
[28:15.2 - 28:21.2] Dev: That needs to get fixed, but it just needs to get.
[28:21.2 - 28:39.2] Dev: There just needs to be an intake button, basically.
[28:39.2 - 28:45.2] Dev: I'm going to get rid of this concept of these two things being super different.
[28:45.2 - 28:58.2] Dev: There's never going to be a time where a product is added unless it's part of a batch period.
[28:58.2 - 29:06.2] Dev: If we need this on the back end or something, that's fine, but the user doesn't really need
[29:06.2 - 29:10.2] Dev: to see it because they should just be basically working from inventory.
[29:10.2 - 29:12.2] Dev: There should be two different things here.
[29:12.2 - 29:17.2] Dev: There should be an intake, and that's basically direct intake, a combination of direct intake,
[29:17.2 - 29:19.2] Dev: and then this thing.
[29:19.2 - 29:27.2] Dev: I want this to be able to just happen super fast, and it should be both the drop down
[29:27.2 - 29:34.2] Dev: and typing, drop down and typing, drop down and typing.
[29:34.2 - 29:42.2] Dev: Strain and product name need to be combined into one thing.
[29:42.2 - 29:54.2] Dev: If the strain validation finds a strain, there should be a way of basically saying,
[29:54.2 - 29:57.2] Dev: hey, does this look right?
[29:57.2 - 30:04.2] Dev: The user can quickly, quickly, yes or no, create a new strain or new product.
[30:04.2 - 30:12.2] Dev: It should allow for creating a new strain, basically.
[30:12.2 - 30:21.2] Dev: Categories, fine, but honestly, subcategory is going to be most important here.
[30:21.2 - 30:26.2] Dev: You can always default to flower, and then there should be subcategories.
[30:26.2 - 30:50.2] Dev: That's fine for now.
[30:51.2 - 30:53.2] Dev: I see what happened here.
[30:53.2 - 30:54.2] Dev: Cool.
[30:54.2 - 30:59.2] Dev: Okay, never mind then.
[30:59.2 - 31:08.2] Dev: That's right.
[31:08.2 - 31:18.2] Dev: Okay, that needs to work.
[31:18.2 - 31:23.2] Dev: I want to be able to tab it in the next one.
[31:23.2 - 31:27.2] Dev: This should always default to consignment.
[31:27.2 - 31:32.2] Dev: It should always default to main warehouse.
[31:32.2 - 31:47.2] Dev: That should work.
[31:47.2 - 31:50.2] Dev: Let's stop there for now.

## Appendix B: Visual Context Notes (from every video frame analyzed)

(Visual context notes from each frame of the video are included below.)


The center column displays a searchable list of available products. A search bar at the top contains the term "sour". Below is a table-like list of product categories such as Concentrate, Edible, Vape, and Flower, each with associated costs, quantities, and an add button. Below this list, a "Line Items" section details the items already added to the order. There are two items: "pop" with a quantity of 5 and a total of $3150.25, and "te - consistency" with a quantity of 1 and a total of $627.61. The total for these items is listed as "2 items in order".

The right column summarizes the order details. At the top, the "Total Margin" is $692.81 (18.3%), and the "Total" order value is $3777.86. Below this, an "Order Preview" card shows what "Harbor Apothecary" will see, listing 2 items, a subtotal of $3777.86, and a margin of 18.3%. The line items are listed again: "Refined Flower - pop" and "Sleek Concentrate - consistency". At the bottom right, there are options for "Order Type" (set to "Sale Order"), a "Save" dropdown, and a prominent blue "Confirm Order" button.

---

## Frame at Minute 15 — Orders > Create

The user is on the 'Orders > Create' page within the TERP application. The left sidebar shows the main navigation, with the 'SALES' category expanded and the 'Orders' sub-item highlighted as the active page. Other visible menu items under 'SALES' include Dashboard, Inbox, Clients, Interest List, and more. The 'INVENTORY' category is collapsed below it. At the bottom of the sidebar, 'Signed in TERP Operator' is displayed with a 'Logout' option.

The main content area is divided into several sections. At the top, a breadcrumb trail reads 'Home > Orders > Create'. To the right of this is a user menu showing 'QA Super Admin' and the application version 'v1.0.0'. A search bar contains the term 'sour'. Below this is a large table listing various product types like Concentrate, Edible, Vape, and Flower, with columns for cost, price, and a quantity selector to add items to the order. It indicates 'Showing 307 of 307 items'.

Below the product selection table is the 'Line Items' section, which currently contains two items: 'pop' (Quantity: 5, Total: $3150.25) and 'te - consistency' (Quantity: 1, Total: $627.61). The columns are Qty, COGS/Unit, Margin, Price/Unit, and Total. The total margin for the 'pop' item is 20.0% ($126.01), and for the 'te - consistency' item, it's 10.0% ($62.76).

On the right side of the screen, an 'Order Preview' panel summarizes the current order for 'What Harbor Apothecary will see'. It shows a total of 2 items, a subtotal of $3777.86, and an overall margin of 18.3%. The line items are listed as 'Refined Flower - pop' and 'Sleek Concentrate - consistency'. The final total is $3777.86, with an estimated profit of $692.81. Below the totals, there is an 'Order Type' dropdown set to 'Quote', a 'Save' button, and a prominent, enabled 'Confirm Quote' button.

---

## Frame at Minute 16 — Orders > Create

The user interface is for a cannabis ERP application named TERP, and the current view is for creating a new quote, as indicated by the breadcrumb navigation 'Orders > Create'. The screen is divided into three main vertical sections. A prominent modal dialog titled 'Finalize Quote?' is centered on the screen, confirming the user's intent to finalize a quote totaling $3777.86. This action is described as irreversible and will create a new order. The modal provides two options: a 'Cancel' button and a blue, primary 'Finalize' button.

The leftmost section is a dark-themed navigation sidebar. Under the 'SALES' category, the 'Orders' item is selected and highlighted. Other visible menu items in this section include Dashboard, Inbox, Clients, Interest List, Sales Sheets, and more. Below the 'SALES' category is a collapsed 'INVENTORY' category. At the bottom of the sidebar, it shows that 'TERP Operator' is signed in, with a 'Logout' option available.

The central area of the screen, partially obscured by the modal, is where the user constructs the quote. It includes a search bar containing the term 'sour' and a list of products. Below this, a 'Line Items' table details the items added to the quote. There are two items: 'pop' (5 units at $630.05 each for a total of $3150.25, with a 20.0% margin) and 'te - consistency' (1 unit at $627.61, with a 10.0% margin). The total number of items is noted as '2 items in order'.

The rightmost section provides an 'Order Preview' for 'What Harbor Apothecary will see'. It summarizes the quote with '2 Items', a subtotal of '$3777.86', and a margin of '18.3%'. It lists the two line items: 'Refined Flower - pop' for $3150.25 and 'Sleek Concentrate - consistency' for $627.61. The final total is confirmed as '$3777.86', with an estimated profit of '$692.81'. Below the preview, there is a disabled 'Confirm Quote' button, likely inactive because of the open modal.

---

## Frame at Minute 17 — Orders > Create

The application is on the 'Orders > Create' page, as indicated by the breadcrumb navigation trail at the top of the main content area. A modal dialog titled 'Finalize Quote?' is open in the center of the screen, overlaying the main interface. This modal asks for confirmation: 'Are you sure you want to finalize this quote? Total: $3777.86. This will create the order and cannot be undone.' It presents two options: a 'Cancel' button and a blue, primary 'Finalize' button.

The left sidebar, under the 'TERP Navigation' header, shows two main categories: 'SALES' and 'INVENTORY'. The 'Orders' link within the 'SALES' section is currently selected, indicated by its blue background. Other visible links under 'SALES' include Dashboard, Inbox, Clients, Interest List, and more. The 'INVENTORY' section includes links like Pick & Pack, Products, and Vendors. At the bottom of the sidebar, 'TERP Operator' is shown as the signed-in user, with a 'Logout' option available.

The main content area behind the modal features a product selection interface. A search bar at the top contains the term 'sour'.
