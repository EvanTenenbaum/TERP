**[00:00.0 - 00:04.8]** Customer: "days or a week, like, I don't mind, um, uh, waiting buddy."

**[00:04.8 - 00:09.5]** Customer: "Like, like there's no point in spinning your wheels if you need a couple more hours or whatever."

**[00:10.0 - 00:15.8]** Developer: "Well, I mean, I think the fact is like, it could just a couple more hours would always be useful."

**[00:15.9 - 00:22.8]** Developer: "And, um, that I still need kind of, I need this feedback."

**[00:23.0 - 00:26.0]** Customer: "Um, okay, great. I love giving feedback, so I'm ready."

**[00:26.5 - 00:28.9]** Developer: "Cool. I, yeah, I appreciate that."

**[00:29.9 - 00:42.4]** Developer: "I feel your patience and, uh, I'm feeling it. I feel actually like pretty good about it now. Um, that I've kind of validated that I'm not just being a total dummy about some of this stuff."

[BUSINESS RULE] Developer establishes meeting purpose: review sidebar items and determine what's helpful vs. what should be removed or deferred.

**[00:42.6 - 00:50.1]** Developer: "Um, but really what I want to do is just go through these, go through all the sidebar things."

**[00:50.2 - 00:59.6]** Developer: "You tell me actually what feels helpful versus what is just like, get rid of it completely or like stash it for far later."

[TERMINOLOGY CHANGE] Developer mentions nomenclature issues need resolution.

**[01:00.0 - 01:06.7]** Developer: "Uh, and also some of the like nomenclature stuff, like I'm still kind of trying to figure out."

**[01:08.2 - 01:14.8]** Developer: "The, I can also add, add, uh, I can have Tigger over or we can do a, I don't know, can you do a three way signal call?"

**[01:16.6 - 01:28.7]** Customer: "I don't know. No, I don't think so. I mean, maybe, I think you can. I mean, I've done, I've done four way signal video calls before. Oh, I guess you have a group. Yeah. That makes sense."

**[01:30.1 - 01:33.5]** Developer: "Well, I don't want to freak Tigger out with a half done thing. Like I already did once."

### Dashboard & Homepage Discussion (01:35 - 05:15)

[SCREEN TRANSITION] Discussion moves to Dashboard page.

**[01:35.2 - 01:36.8]** Developer: "So we already talked about the dashboard."

[DECISION] Customer preference for default landing page.

**[01:37.2 - 01:43.3]** Developer: "Um, when you log in to this application, what's the first thing that you want to see?"

**[01:44.8 - 01:48.2]** Customer: "Inventory, dashboard, cash."

[VISUAL CONTEXT] Dashboard page visible showing Cash Flow section (Cash Collected: $5,828,886.76) and Sales leaderboard.

**[01:49.1 - 02:05.6]** Customer: "Uh, I was just going to open up my current laptop. It doesn't really matter what I probably inventory would be where I'd like it to pop up, you know, just because that's the thing we scroll through the most, like just understanding who we need to pay. And, and, um, yeah."

[BUSINESS RULE] Customer explains daily workflow priorities.

**[02:06.3 - 02:18.9]** Customer: "Um, and what's aging and like, what do I need to focus on with my day? Because it's basically this job is like Tetris and it's like, what are you out of? What do you have too much of what's about to go bad? What am I going to lose money on?"

**[02:19.6 - 02:25.6]** Developer: "Yeah. So that can we actually unpack that for a second that this actually feels really helpful. Okay."

**[02:26.1 - 02:33.6]** Developer: "So inventory right now is kind of your like homepage because of all the things that you just mentioned. Right."

**[02:34.5 - 02:42.0]** Developer: "Um, but conceptually here, like you aren't going to have to scroll through inventory to figure out who you're going to have to pay. Right."

[BUSINESS RULE] Customer describes current inventory analysis workflow.

**[02:42.5 - 03:00.2]** Customer: "Or yeah, I can conceptually like organize it by what is old or what I own or what, um, uh, I'm low on, like I'm low on candy ends from five to seven."

**[03:00.5 - 03:11.6]** Developer: "Okay. So, um, what I hear low on patch feature is not actually in inventory that might be in needs or something, but yeah. Right."

**[03:12.0 - 03:27.1]** Developer: "So that's what, I guess I'm trying to figure out like whether a dashboard would be helpful if it gave you a better, just quick snapshot of the things that right now, you know, you're still very good at fat and fast at, because you've been doing a long time, but like you scroll through inventory to look for, it sounds like aging inventory."

[BUSINESS RULE] Customer explains current limitation finding inventory counts by category.

**[03:27.6 - 03:49.2]** Customer: "Yeah. Like, like I can't like, like the only way I can find out how many candies I have right now is by using your list generator, selecting for candies and then selecting the column. And then I can't even tell like how many I have in each price category, unless I use that feature you gave me, but then it's a little complicated because there's so many price categories. So it's not just like five to 700 or something."

**[03:52.2 - 03:59.7]** Developer: "Okay, cool. That's helpful. Um, some of this will probably be in the MVP. Some of it might not be, but, um, yeah, this is great."

[DECISION] Dashboard requirements confirmed.

**[04:00.0 - 04:12.4]** Developer: "Okay. So, um, you want inventory snapshot, like you just discussed, you want who you owe money to or like, yeah. Who needs to get paid or do you need to know that? Or is that something that you would be comfy with?"

**[04:16.2 - 04:27.8]** Customer: "On dashboard, on dashboard, I go to dashboard and I can see payables, due payables, scheduled office owned total units on hand."

[BUSINESS RULE] Customer specifies desired inventory breakdown categories.

**[04:28.4 - 04:50.4]** Customer: "And it'd be cool to see like depths, indoor, out, smalls, um, candy ends in various price brackets, you know, kind of like, that'd be cool. You know, depths from one to 200, from two to 300, from three to four, you know, just like some basic flower categories that we could create. That would be, that'd be cool."

**[04:50.7 - 04:55.8]** Developer: "Okay. And then, you know, like how much money's on hand, you know, that kind of stuff."

**[04:56.7 - 05:02.1]** Customer: "And aging, uh, inventory. Does that feel like, okay, got it."

**[05:02.4 - 05:14.7]** Developer: "Um, how do you deal with highlight of like a window of like the five, 10 oldest things, you know, kind of like focus on me."

**[05:15.1 - 05:15.5]** Customer: "Great."

### Calendar Integration Discussion (05:16 - 05:50)

[DECISION] Calendar integration deprioritized.

**[05:16.7 - 05:34.8]** Developer: "In terms of your schedule, I imagine that like before you cop in the car, whatever you just like, look at the, um, the calendar, your calendar, um, does that feel like an important thing to have quick access to, I don't think so."

**[05:34.8 - 05:46.9]** Customer: "I mean, I think it's just mostly, I think that's a later version thing. I think that's, it's just so easy to open my phone and confirm everyone and drag an appointment around or make it bigger or smaller. All with the touch of a finger. Yeah."

**[05:47.2 - 05:49.1]** Developer: "Okay. Great. Yeah."

[VISUAL CONTEXT] Clients page showing list with columns: Name, Type, Contact, LTV, Debt, Orders. Total: 101 clients.

**[05:50.4 - 06:10.6]** Developer: "Um, all right. So this is a new concept that you probably, I mean, yeah, I'm not sure how much you'll need it, but you might want to be able to quickly just click into your clients and, you know, sort by certain things, like see who has the highest debt or who has the most orders or things like that. And this is separate from like the leaderboard stuff."

**[06:10.6 - 06:23.2]** Developer: "But I'm curious when you look at, um, just an overview page like that, like are there specific columns that would just be like contact doesn't seem like an important column to have it at all."

**[06:23.4 - 06:28.9]** Developer: "Are there certain things that you would just love to be able to just like quickly just like sort by."

[BUSINESS RULE] Customer identifies key client metrics.

**[06:29.0 - 06:45.6]** Customer: "Yeah. That's a great, that's a great question. Um, I think it would be useful to know how often, um, you could kinda, you know, like who we haven't seen in a while, who do I need to reach out to? Nice. You know, so that, that'd be valuable."

**[06:45.8 - 07:01.3]** Customer: "Um, um, maybe who's, um, they're kind of overdue for an order or overdue for a drop, you know, I should reach out to them kind of thing. That would be really good."

[UI ELEMENT] Discussion of client starring/favoriting feature.

**[07:01.9 - 07:11.2]** Developer: "And does it feel important to be able to star certain clients? So they're like always at the top or something like, um, you know, it seems like,"

**[07:11.2 - 07:26.6]** Customer: "yeah, I mean, I'm going to be able to click in, I'm assuming I can click on this and see their last order and what it was, or I can organize by when they were last there so I can see their recent order or something. Great. Yeah."

**[07:27.4 - 07:36.2]** Customer: "Um, I'm just guessing, I'm just guessing what is the purpose of this sheet? Well, I mean, the real purpose of the sheet is also just to be able to like, this is where you come to add clients."

[BUSINESS RULE] Contact information not needed.

**[07:37.4 - 07:49.0]** Developer: "Um, it's a pretty simple process. Um, and we just, we need one place basically where it's just like, we don't need address information. Oh yeah, I know."

[UI ELEMENT] Feature flags mentioned for hiding unnecessary fields.

**[07:49.5 - 07:59.9]** Developer: "Um, all that stuff also, like most of that stuff is on a feature flag. So, um, we just click it and it does like we turn off the flag and it disappears. Okay, cool. Yeah. Love it."

**[08:02.7 - 08:06.7]** Customer: "I just like, I don't know any of my clients emails. Yeah. Nor should you need to."

[BUSINESS RULE] Minimal client information needed for adding clients.

**[08:17.2 - 08:43.0]** Developer: "Um, do you, in terms of adding clients, there's not, you know, you're not going to need to put any of this contact information, um, other than certain things like, yeah, payment terms. This will also be the area that, um, initial like credit settings go or things like that."

[BUSINESS RULE] Client creation workflow - infrequent operation.

**[08:43.8 - 09:04.0]** Developer: "Are you able to, or do you create client? I guess you don't really have this concept. I'm trying to figure out when you're going to create a client because you need to be able, like a client, either like a buyer or a vendor, there's a concept that like, you're going to need to add them as an entity before you transfer. act with them. Okay. Um, does that,"

**[09:10.1 - 09:21.6]** Customer: "I don't want it to be overburdened some, but it's just kind of a reality of like a, of a system like we rarely add plants. So it's going to happen like four times a year, you know? Yeah. Okay. Yeah."

[BUSINESS RULE] One-time visitors can use existing client's tab.

**[09:26.3 - 09:40.6]** Customer: "Yeah. And if someone's coming in once, we can just put it on somebody else's tab, you know, like if I see Bob every week and Bob brings his buddy Tony one time, then yeah, yeah. Right. Right. You can just go on Bob's tab. Okay."

**[10:06.7 - 10:10.8]** Developer: "do these tabs look interesting to you?"

[UI ELEMENT] Master Score explained.

**[10:12.8 - 10:27.9]** Customer: "Um, master score is like a combination of how quickly they're turning over their debt and how, how, I don't know, I'm assuming it's some combination of things. Exactly. Which, which is also like kind of like a recipe or formula thing that we can control."

[BUSINESS RULE] Debt warning system requested.

**[11:14.0 - 11:27.5]** Customer: "and I believe it does have a debt turnover, but yeah, I was mostly, I was also really excited about, you said you were gonna have some kind of tool that would like warn us when clients debts are going bad and to stop loaning the money kind of thing. Oh yeah. Yeah. Um,"

**[11:33.3 - 11:44.5]** Customer: "because you know, like that could be, um, there could be even far less options on that sheet, you know, on the, um, on the, it has, it has a lot of information. Like,"

[UI ELEMENT] Reliability metric clarified.

**[11:46.0 - 11:56.3]** Customer: "I love, I love it, but we'll almost need like a, like what's reliability, like how often they show up or this is their payment behavior actually. So this is the, how quickly they repaid debts."

[DECISION] Financial + Reliability most important metrics.

**[11:56.8 - 12:07.4]** Customer: "But combining that with financial sounds like that is the most important, like that actually is more important. Um,"

[UI ELEMENT] Trend vs Growth distinction.

**[12:09.0 - 12:28.3]** Developer: "trend is kind of growth, right? Yeah, exactly. Um, well trend is their ranking. Like if they're doing better or worse, basically. Um, growth is like actually how much they're spending with you is growing. So it's kind of like, um, velocity."

**[12:30.4 - 12:49.8]** Customer: "Got it. Yeah. We'll need a little explanation on these. And then, um, uh, yeah, I mean maybe we can just combine them into, into less things, um, but not, not very important as long as I, I don't grasp it now, but I, I'm sure I will grasp it eventually. Yeah. Um,"

[UI ELEMENT] Engagement metric explained.

So the thing that you see up here at the top, which is these customized weights, yeah. Um, this contributes to the master score basically."

**[13:26.9 - 13:45.5]** Developer: "So how much revenue they've done on time payments, how quickly, how much they're ordering, what your margin is, how much of their credit they're using, um, year over year growth. So we could change that to a different sort of growth and then days since last order. Like,"

**[13:46.2 - 13:57.0]** Customer: "nice. That's cool. I love that. And so a master score is just a combination of all of them. Yeah. I mean you can rank them or weight them differently. Um, these are,"

[BUSINESS RULE] Accounting staff workflow considerations.

**[14:49.5 - 15:15.8]** Developer: "So with that in mind, I guess thinking about what somebody who's working in your accounting divisions, um, dashboard or just like command center would look like, I imagine, you know, this sort of stuff is interesting for you, but really what they're going to want is just like this, which is basically just like, here are all the actions I can receive a payment. I can pay somebody journal entries, um, expenses."

[BUSINESS RULE] Cash handling workflow explained.

[USER ACTION] Developer expresses disappointment about inventory not working.

**[16:28.6 - 16:43.2]** Developer: "I'm pretty disappointed that this isn't working yet, but, um, I feel pretty close on it. Honestly, like once, once all the inventory that I know is in the system is listed here, it kind of unblocks everything else. This is like kind of,"
