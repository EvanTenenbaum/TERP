**Transaction History Module:**
- `getHistory` - Fetches transactions with multi-filter support
- Uses `clientTransactions` table with proper ordering

**Dashboard Module:**
- `getConfig` - Fetches portal configuration for the client
- `getKPIs` - Calculates real-time KPIs (balance, YTD spend, active needs/supply count)

**Marketplace Module:**
- `getNeeds` - Fetches client needs from database
- `createNeed` - Creates new need with auto-expiration calculation
- `updateNeed` - Updates existing need
- `cancelNeed` - Cancels need (sets status to CANCELLED)
- `getSupply` - Placeholder for supply (requires schema update)
- `createSupply` - Placeholder for supply creation
- `updateSupply` - Placeholder for supply update
- `cancelSupply` - Placeholder for supply cancellation

**All queries use:**
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database access

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Integration

### Tables Used

1. **invoices** - AR module data source
2. **bills** - AP module data source
3. **clientTransactions** - Transaction history data source
4. **clientNeeds** - Marketplace needs data source
5. **vipPortalConfigurations** - Portal settings and feature flags
6. **clients** - Client information and balances

### Queries Implemented

- **AR Summary:** Aggregates total outstanding, overdue amount, open invoice count
- **AP Summary:** Aggregates total owed, overdue amount, open bill count
- **Transaction Summary:** Counts transactions, sums values, finds last transaction date
- **KPI Calculations:** YTD spend, current balance, active needs count
- **Filtered Lists:** Search by number, filter by status/type, order by date

## üé® UI/UX Highlights

### Mobile-First Design
Every component built with mobile as the primary target:
- **Card-based layouts** instead of tables for better mobile UX
- **Stacked information** for easy scanning on small screens
- **Full-width buttons** on mobile, inline on desktop
- **Responsive grids:** 1 column mobile ‚Üí 2-4 columns desktop
- **Touch-optimized** button sizes (minimum 44px tap targets)
- **Scrollable dialogs** with max-height for long forms

### Consistent Design Language
- **Color-coded status badges** across all modules
- **Icon system** for visual hierarchy (FileText, Receipt, History, Package)
- **Muted foreground** for secondary information
- **Bold amounts** for financial data
- **Destructive variants** for overdue/urgent items
- **Secondary variants** for completed/paid items

### Accessibility
- Proper semantic HTML (Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, etc.)
- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly structure
- High contrast color scheme

## üöß Remaining Work (Phase 3-4)

### Phase 3: Engagement Modules (Not Started)
- ‚ùå VIP Tier System (dynamic tier calculation)
- ‚ùå Credit Center (interactive credit calculator)
- ‚ùå Recommendations Engine (actionable suggestions)
- ‚ùå Leaderboard (anonymized rankings)

### Phase 4: Polish & Production Features (Not Started)

1. **Supply Marketplace Backend:** UI is complete, but backend requires schema update to link `vendorSupply` to `clients` table (currently uses `vendorId`)
2. **PDF Downloads:** Buttons are in place but need PDF generation library integration
3. **Email Notifications:** Password reset emails not sent (token returned in response for now)
