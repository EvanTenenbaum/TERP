# TERP ERP System Design System Document

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The TERP redesign aims to address longstanding ERP UX challenges: overwhelming complexity, inconsistent design, and poor user adoption. Research underscores that **user-centric simplicity, progressive disclosure, and role-based personalization** are critical to transforming TERP into an intuitive, efficient platform that empowers diverse users across complex workflows. Leveraging modern UI frameworks and design systems—especially those optimizing for data density and enterprise-scale complexity—will enable TERP to compete with leading ERP solutions.

We recommend adopting a **custom design system built on headless component libraries (Radix UI) combined with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui’s curated components**, layered with strict governance to ensure maintainability and consistency. This approach balances flexibility with scalability, allowing TERP to deliver highly customized, accessible, and responsive interfaces. Navigation should be structured with **multi-level, role-based hierarchies**, and components (tables, forms, dashboards, search) must prioritize **power-user efficiency and accessibility**. The implementation will proceed in phased iterations focusing on foundational architecture, core UI components, accessibility compliance, and finally, mobile-first responsiveness and onboarding enhancements.

By adhering to these principles and leveraging the Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS stack, TERP can achieve measurable improvements in user satisfaction, task efficiency, and adoption rates, positioning itself as a world-class ERP system.

## 2. Core Design Principles

| Principle                         | Description                                                                                                  | Actionable Recommendation                                              |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **User-Centric Simplicity**      | Prioritize essential features and progressively disclose complexity to reduce cognitive overload.            | Implement multi-level disclosure; show only relevant data per role.    |
| **Role-Based Personalization**   | Tailor navigation, dashboards, and workflows to user roles and tasks to minimize clutter and improve focus.  | Enable customizable dashboards and context-specific menus.             |
| **Consistency & Governance**     | Maintain uniform UI patterns, terminology, and interactions across all modules to reduce learning curves.    | Establish a strict design system governance with documented standards. |
| **Data Density & Clarity**       | Optimize layouts for high information density without sacrificing readability or usability.                   | Use compact, well-structured tables and dashboards with clear hierarchy.|
| **Accessibility & Inclusivity**  | Design for all users, including those with disabilities, meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards as a minimum.           | Use semantic HTML, keyboard operability, high contrast, and ARIA roles.|
| **Performance & Responsiveness** | Ensure fast load times and seamless operation across devices, supporting mobile-first workflows.              | Utilize SSR, client/server caching, and responsive design best practices.|
| **Progressive Onboarding**       | Replace upfront training with contextual, in-app guidance and staged workflows for better learnability.       | Embed tooltips, guided tours, and smart tips triggered contextually.   |

## 3. Design System Selection

| Option               | Pros                                                                                                  | Cons                                                                                           | Recommendation                          |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Material Design**   | Strong visual hierarchy, scalable, widely adopted, extensive tooling support                          | Requires heavy customization for ERP complexity and legacy integration; less tailored for enterprise data density | Not recommended as primary base       |
| **Fluent UI**         | Enterprise-grade, excellent legacy-modern bridging, cross-platform, AI integration-friendly          | More Windows/Microsoft ecosystem-centric; may require customization for TERP branding          | Viable alternative; consider for cross-platform modules |
| **Custom (Radix UI + Tailwind + Shadcn/ui)** | Highly flexible, accessible primitives, Tailwind enables rapid styling, Shadcn/ui speeds initial dev | Shadcn/ui needs governance to avoid maintenance issues; requires initial investment to build full system | **Recommended for TERP** due to flexibility, accessibility, and alignment with Next.js/TypeScript/Tailwind stack |

### Justification:

- TERP demands **highly customized, data-dense, and accessible UI components** that off-the-shelf systems cannot fully satisfy.
- Headless libraries like Radix UI provide **accessible, unstyled primitives** that can be tailored precisely to TERP’s unique workflows.
- Tailwind CSS enables **rapid, consistent styling** aligned with TERP branding.
- Shadcn/ui offers curated components accelerating development but must be integrated under a **robust governance framework** to avoid design drift.
- The chosen stack complements Next.js and TypeScript for **performance, maintainability, and scalability**.

## 4. Navigation Architecture

### Hierarchy Levels & Patterns

| Level                | Description                                                | Pattern Recommendation                        | Notes                                                               |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Level 1: Product Bundle Switch** | Top-level switch between major TERP modules (e.g., Finance, HR, Inventory) | Dropdown or global header menu                 | Allows users to switch major domains without cognitive overload     |
| **Level 2: Primary Navigation**    | Core functional areas within each module (e.g., Invoices, Reports, Settings) | Horizontal tab bar or sidebar menu             | Use sidebar drawer for desktop; bottom nav on mobile                |
| **Level 3: Secondary Navigation**  | Contextual navigation related to selected primary area (e.g., Invoice types, filters) | Collapsible sidebar or contextual tabs        | Provides task-focused access without overwhelming the main nav      |
| **Level 4: Contextual Controls**   | Page-specific actions, filters, and sub-navigation               | Inline controls, breadcrumbs, toolbars          | Maintain breadcrumbs for orientation and quick backtracking         |

### Navigation Patterns:

- **Drawer Navigation (Sidebar):** Primary pattern on desktop for deep hierarchies — collapsible, persistent, with clear icons + labels.
- **Tab-Based Navigation:** For limited primary sections (3–7), horizontal tabs provide quick switching.
- **Bottom Navigation:** On mobile, provide quick access to 3-5 most frequent actions.
- **Breadcrumb Trails:** Always visible on data-heavy screens to maintain spatial orientation.
- **Search Bar:** Persistent, prominent global search with autocomplete and faceted filters.

### Role-Based Customization

- Dashboards and navigation menus should be **personalizable** by role and user preference.
- Hide irrelevant modules or features based on role permissions.
- Allow users to save **favorite views** or shortcuts for efficiency.
