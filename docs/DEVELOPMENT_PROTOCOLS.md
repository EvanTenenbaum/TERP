## System Integration & Change Management Protocol

### 1. IMPACT ANALYSIS (Before Making Changes)

Before implementing any change, perform a comprehensive impact analysis:

- **Identify affected files:** List all components, pages, utilities, and configuration files that will be modified
- **Map dependencies:** 
  - What components import this file?
  - What does this file import?
  - What data structures flow through this component?
  - What routes or navigation paths reference this?
- **Check for ripple effects:**
  - Will this change break navigation or routing?
  - Will this affect data structures or type definitions?
  - Will this impact UI consistency or design system patterns?
  - Will this require updates to mock data or API calls?
- **Create update checklist:** List ALL files that need updates to maintain system coherence

### 2. INTEGRATION VERIFICATION (During Changes)

When implementing changes, maintain system-wide coherence:

- **Batch related updates:** Update ALL related files in a single operation, not piecemeal
- **Maintain consistency across:**
  - Component props and interfaces
  - TypeScript type definitions
  - Routing paths and navigation links
  - Data schemas and mock data structures
  - Styling patterns (colors, spacing, typography)
  - Component variants and design tokens
- **Verify imports/exports:** Ensure all imports remain valid after renaming or restructuring
- **Preserve design system:** Keep consistent use of shadcn/ui components and Tailwind utilities
- **Update documentation:** Reflect changes in comments, README files, and type documentation

### 3. SYSTEM-WIDE VALIDATION (After Changes)

After implementing changes, validate the entire system:

- **Run `webdev_check_status`:** Verify TypeScript errors are resolved and no build errors exist
- **Test navigation flows:** 
  - Click through all navigation links
  - Verify no broken routes or 404 errors
  - Test back/forward browser navigation
- **Verify data flows:**
  - Check that mock data renders correctly
  - Ensure data transformations work as expected
  - Validate that all UI components receive correct props
- **Visual regression check:**
  - Verify all pages still render correctly
  - Check responsive behavior at different screen sizes
  - Ensure no layout breaks or styling regressions
- **Browser testing:** Test in the actual browser, not just TypeScript compilation

### 4. BREAKING CHANGE PROTOCOL

If a requested change requires any of the following, **STOP and report to the user FIRST:**

**Triggers for Breaking Change Protocol:**
- Refactoring more than 5 files
- Changing core data structures, schemas, or type definitions
- Restructuring routing or navigation architecture
- Rebuilding major UI components or layouts
- Migrating to different libraries or frameworks
- Changing state management patterns
- Modifying API contracts or data fetching logic
- Altering authentication or authorization flows

**Required Report Format:**

```
üö® BREAKING CHANGE ALERT

SCOPE:
- X files affected
- Y components require refactoring
- Z routes need restructuring

REASON:
[Explain why this change requires major refactoring]

AFFECTED SYSTEMS:
- [List all major systems/features affected]

RISKS:
- [Potential breaking changes]
- [Data migration concerns]
- [Backward compatibility issues]

ALTERNATIVES:
- [Option 1: Description]
- [Option 2: Description]

RECOMMENDATION:
[Your recommended approach]

‚è∏Ô∏è AWAITING USER CONFIRMATION TO PROCEED
```

**Wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding with breaking changes.**

### 5. CHECKPOINT DISCIPLINE

Maintain proper version control and recovery points:

- **Before major refactoring:** Always save a checkpoint before attempting significant architectural changes
- **After successful features:** Save checkpoints after successfully integrating new features or completing milestones
- **Never deliver broken states:** Do not save checkpoints or deliver to users when the system has known errors
- **Meaningful descriptions:** Write clear, descriptive checkpoint messages that explain what was accomplished

## Production-Ready Code Standard

### Absolute Requirements

**NO PLACEHOLDERS OR STUBS**

‚ùå **NEVER use:**
- "TODO", "FIXME", "Coming Soon", "Placeholder"
- "To be implemented", "Not yet working"
- Pseudo-code or commented-out logic
- Empty function bodies with comments
- Mock data labeled as "temporary" without full implementation
- Disabled features with "enable later" comments

‚úÖ **ALWAYS implement:**
- Complete, functional, production-ready code
- Real interactions for every UI element
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Full validation logic for all forms
- Complete data flows from source to UI
- Graceful degradation for edge cases

### Full Implementation Mandate

Every deliverable must meet these standards:

1. **Components:**
   - Fully functional with all props properly typed
   - Complete interaction logic (clicks, hovers, focus states)
   - Proper accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
   - Loading and error states handled
   - Responsive design implemented

2. **Features:**
   - Work end-to-end from user action to result
   - Include proper validation and error messages
   - Handle edge cases gracefully
   - Provide user feedback for all actions

3. **Data Flows:**
   - Complete from source to UI rendering
   - Use realistic, comprehensive mock data if backend unavailable
   - Include proper type definitions
   - Handle loading, success, and error states

4. **Forms:**
   - Full validation logic (client-side)
   - Clear error messages
   - Submission handling with feedback
   - Proper disabled/loading states during submission

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Try-catch blocks where appropriate
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Fallback UI for error states
   - Console logging for debugging (can be removed in production)

### Exception Protocol - If Stubs Are Unavoidable

If technical constraints genuinely require creating incomplete implementation:

**STOP and explicitly report:**

```
üö® INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION ALERT

INCOMPLETE FEATURE: [Name]

WHAT IS INCOMPLETE:
- [Specific functionality missing]

WHY IT'S INCOMPLETE:
- [Technical constraint or blocker]

MISSING FUNCTIONALITY:
- [Detailed list of what's not implemented]

COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS:
- [What would be needed to complete it]

COMPLETION PLAN:
- [When/how it will be completed]

‚è∏Ô∏è AWAITING USER ACKNOWLEDGMENT
```

**Wait for user acknowledgment before proceeding.**

### Task Completion Reporting

When reporting task completion, MUST include:

‚úÖ **Production Ready Confirmation:**
- "All features are production-ready and fully functional"
- "No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete implementations"

‚úÖ **Known Limitations:**
- List any intentional simplifications (e.g., "Using mock data instead of API")
- Explain any features intentionally scoped out

‚úÖ **Incomplete Work Alerts:**
- Flag ANY incomplete work with üö® alerts
- Provide clear reasoning and completion plan

‚úÖ **Status Declaration:**
- "STATUS: PRODUCTION READY" or
- "STATUS: INCOMPLETE - [specific reason]"
