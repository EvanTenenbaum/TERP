## System Integration & Change Management Protocol

### 1. IMPACT ANALYSIS (Before Making Changes)

Before implementing any change, perform a comprehensive impact analysis:

- **Identify affected files:** List all components, pages, utilities, and configuration files that will be modified
- **Map dependencies:** 
  - What components import this file?
  - What does this file import?
  - What data structures flow through this component?
  - What routes or navigation paths reference this?
- **Check for ripple effects:**
  - Will this change break navigation or routing?
  - Will this affect data structures or type definitions?
  - Will this impact UI consistency or design system patterns?
  - Will this require updates to mock data or API calls?
- **Create update checklist:** List ALL files that need updates to maintain system coherence

### 2. INTEGRATION VERIFICATION (During Changes)

When implementing changes, maintain system-wide coherence:

- **Batch related updates:** Update ALL related files in a single operation, not piecemeal
- **Maintain consistency across:**
  - Component props and interfaces
  - TypeScript type definitions
  - Routing paths and navigation links
  - Data schemas and mock data structures
  - Styling patterns (colors, spacing, typography)
  - Component variants and design tokens
- **Verify imports/exports:** Ensure all imports remain valid after renaming or restructuring
- **Preserve design system:** Keep consistent use of shadcn/ui components and Tailwind utilities
- **Update documentation:** Reflect changes in comments, README files, and type documentation

### 3. SYSTEM-WIDE VALIDATION (After Changes)

After implementing changes, validate the entire system:

- **Run `webdev_check_status`:** Verify TypeScript errors are resolved and no build errors exist
- **Test navigation flows:** 
  - Click through all navigation links
  - Verify no broken routes or 404 errors
  - Test back/forward browser navigation
- **Verify data flows:**
  - Check that mock data renders correctly
  - Ensure data transformations work as expected
  - Validate that all UI components receive correct props
- **Visual regression check:**
  - Verify all pages still render correctly
  - Check responsive behavior at different screen sizes
  - Ensure no layout breaks or styling regressions
- **Browser testing:** Test in the actual browser, not just TypeScript compilation

### 4. BREAKING CHANGE PROTOCOL

If a requested change requires any of the following, **STOP and report to the user FIRST:**

**Triggers for Breaking Change Protocol:**
- Refactoring more than 5 files
- Changing core data structures, schemas, or type definitions
- Restructuring routing or navigation architecture
- Rebuilding major UI components or layouts
- Migrating to different libraries or frameworks
- Changing state management patterns
- Modifying API contracts or data fetching logic
- Altering authentication or authorization flows

**Required Report Format:**

```
üö® BREAKING CHANGE ALERT

SCOPE:
- X files affected
- Y components require refactoring
- Z routes need restructuring

REASON:
[Explain why this change requires major refactoring]

AFFECTED SYSTEMS:
- [List all major systems/features affected]

RISKS:
- [Potential breaking changes]
- [Data migration concerns]
- [Backward compatibility issues]

ALTERNATIVES:
- [Option 1: Description]
- [Option 2: Description]

RECOMMENDATION:
[Your recommended approach]

‚è∏Ô∏è AWAITING USER CONFIRMATION TO PROCEED
```

**Wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding with breaking changes.**

### 5. CHECKPOINT DISCIPLINE

Maintain proper version control and recovery points:

- **Before major refactoring:** Always save a checkpoint before attempting significant architectural changes
- **After successful features:** Save checkpoints after successfully integrating new features or completing milestones
- **Never deliver broken states:** Do not save checkpoints or deliver to users when the system has known errors
- **Meaningful descriptions:** Write clear, descriptive checkpoint messages that explain what was accomplished

---

## Production-Ready Code Standard

### Absolute Requirements

**NO PLACEHOLDERS OR STUBS**

‚ùå **NEVER use:**
- "TODO", "FIXME", "Coming Soon", "Placeholder"
- "To be implemented", "Not yet working"
- Pseudo-code or commented-out logic
- Empty function bodies with comments
- Mock data labeled as "temporary" without full implementation
- Disabled features with "enable later" comments

‚úÖ **ALWAYS implement:**
- Complete, functional, production-ready code
- Real interactions for every UI element
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Full validation logic for all forms
- Complete data flows from source to UI
- Graceful degradation for edge cases

### Full Implementation Mandate

Every deliverable must meet these standards:

1. **Components:**
   - Fully functional with all props properly typed
   - Complete interaction logic (clicks, hovers, focus states)
   - Proper accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
   - Loading and error states handled
   - Responsive design implemented

2. **Features:**
   - Work end-to-end from user action to result
   - Include proper validation and error messages
   - Handle edge cases gracefully
   - Provide user feedback for all actions

3. **Data Flows:**
   - Complete from source to UI rendering
   - Use realistic, comprehensive mock data if backend unavailable
   - Include proper type definitions
   - Handle loading, success, and error states

4. **Forms:**
   - Full validation logic (client-side)
   - Clear error messages
   - Submission handling with feedback
   - Proper disabled/loading states during submission

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Try-catch blocks where appropriate
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Fallback UI for error states
   - Console logging for debugging (can be removed in production)

### Exception Protocol - If Stubs Are Unavoidable

If technical constraints genuinely require creating incomplete implementation:

**STOP and explicitly report:**

```
üö® INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION ALERT

INCOMPLETE FEATURE: [Name]

WHAT IS INCOMPLETE:
- [Specific functionality missing]

WHY IT'S INCOMPLETE:
- [Technical constraint or blocker]

MISSING FUNCTIONALITY:
- [Detailed list of what's not implemented]

COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS:
- [What would be needed to complete it]

COMPLETION PLAN:
- [When/how it will be completed]

‚è∏Ô∏è AWAITING USER ACKNOWLEDGMENT
```

**Wait for user acknowledgment before proceeding.**

### Task Completion Reporting

When reporting task completion, MUST include:

‚úÖ **Production Ready Confirmation:**
- "All features are production-ready and fully functional"
- "No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete implementations"

‚úÖ **Known Limitations:**
- List any intentional simplifications (e.g., "Using mock data instead of API")
- Explain any features intentionally scoped out

‚úÖ **Incomplete Work Alerts:**
- Flag ANY incomplete work with üö® alerts
- Provide clear reasoning and completion plan

‚úÖ **Status Declaration:**
- "STATUS: PRODUCTION READY" or
- "STATUS: INCOMPLETE - [specific reason]"

## Deployment Monitoring Protocol

### ALWAYS Monitor Deployments After Push

Whenever code is pushed to GitHub, **immediately monitor the deployment** to catch issues early.

#### Required Actions After Every `git push`:

1. **Wait for Build** (2-3 minutes)
   - Don't assume success
   - Actively wait and monitor

2. **Check Deployment Status**
   - Render: Check deployment logs in dashboard or via API
   - Railway: Check deployment status and logs
   - Vercel: Check deployment status

3. **Verify Application Health**
   - Load the production URL
   - Check for 502/500 errors
   - Verify critical pages load
   - Check browser console for errors

4. **Review Deployment Logs**
   - Look for ERROR messages
   - Check migration success
   - Verify environment variables loaded
   - Confirm server started successfully

5. **Take Immediate Action on Failures**
   - Don't wait for user to report issues
   - Debug and fix immediately
   - Roll back if necessary

#### Deployment Credentials

Stored in: `/docs/DEPLOYMENT_CREDENTIALS.md` (DO NOT COMMIT TO PUBLIC REPOS)

- **Render API Key:** For autonomous deployment monitoring
- **Railway Token:** For CLI access and monitoring

#### Autonomous Monitoring Commands

**Render:**
```bash
# Check service status
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $RENDER_API_KEY" \
  https://api.render.com/v1/services

# Get deployment logs
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $RENDER_API_KEY" \
  https://api.render.com/v1/services/{serviceId}/deploys
```

**Railway:**
```bash
export RAILWAY_TOKEN=your_token
railway status
railway logs
```

### Why This Matters

- **Catch issues immediately** before they affect users
- **Faster debugging** with fresh context
- **Production reliability** through proactive monitoring
- **Autonomous operation** reduces manual intervention

**Remember:** A successful `git push` doesn't mean successful deployment. Always verify!

---

## Version Management Protocol

### MANDATORY: Update Version on Every GitHub Push

To ensure version traceability and deployment verification, **every single GitHub push MUST include a version update**.

#### Version File Location

`/version.json` in the project root:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "commit": "abc1234",
  "date": "2025-10-27",
  "description": "Brief description of changes"
}
```

#### Required Actions Before Every `git push`:

1. **Update Commit Hash**
   ```bash
   # Get current commit hash (short form)
   git rev-parse --short HEAD
   ```
   - Update `commit` field in `version.json` with the current commit hash

2. **Update Date**
   - Set `date` field to current date in YYYY-MM-DD format

3. **Update Description**
   - Briefly describe what changed in this push
   - Examples: "Added version display", "Fixed login bug", "Updated accounting module"

4. **Increment Version (if applicable)**
   - For major features: increment minor version (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0)
   - For bug fixes: increment patch version (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1)
   - For breaking changes: increment major version (1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0)

#### Version Display Implementation

The version is displayed persistently in the application header:

- **Desktop:** Shows both version number and commit hash
- **Mobile:** Shows commit hash only (space-constrained)
- **Location:** `client/src/components/layout/AppHeader.tsx`
- **Import:** `import versionInfo from '../../../version.json'`

#### Why This Matters

- **Deployment Verification:** User can verify they're working with the correct deployed version
- **Debugging:** Quickly identify which code version is running in production
- **Traceability:** Link production issues to specific commits
- **Accountability:** Clear history of what changed and when

#### Enforcement

**This is a MANDATORY protocol. Every Manus agent MUST:**

1. Check `version.json` before pushing to GitHub
2. Update the commit hash to match the current HEAD
3. Update the date to current date
4. Update the description with a brief summary of changes
5. Only then proceed with `git push`

**Failure to update version.json is a protocol violation.**

## 13. Future Architecture Compatibility Protocol

### Context

TERP is evolving toward a **secure home office architecture** with:
- Air-gapped core server
- VPN-only access (WireGuard)
- Multi-factor authentication (VPN + device certificate + biometric)
- Offline-first Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Redis caching layer
- Comprehensive monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)

This evolution is planned for **8 weeks / 160 hours** of implementation work.

### The Challenge

How do we continue current development without creating work that will need to be undone or redone when implementing this vision?

### The Solution

All development work MUST be **forward-compatible** with the future architecture by following these protocols.

---

### 13.1 Authentication Abstraction

**Rule:** Use `authProvider` interface, never call authentication provider (Clerk) directly.

**Why:** When we add MFA (multi-factor authentication), we can replace the implementation without changing any calling code.

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ GOOD - Uses abstraction
import { authProvider } from '../_core/authProvider';
const user = await authProvider.requireAuth(req);

// ‚ùå BAD - Direct Clerk call (will need refactoring)
import { getAuth } from '@clerk/express';
const { userId } = getAuth(req);
```

**Files:**
- `server/_core/authProvider.ts` - Authentication abstraction interface
- All routers MUST use this interface

**Verification:**
- [ ] No direct Clerk imports in new code
- [ ] All authentication uses `authProvider` interface

---

### 13.2 Data Access Abstraction

**Rule:** Use `dataProvider` interface, never call `getDb()` directly.

**Why:** When we add Redis caching and offline sync, we can intercept all data access without changing business logic.

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ GOOD - Uses abstraction
import { dataProvider } from '../_core/dataProvider';
const orders = await dataProvider.query(db => 
  db.select().from(orders).where(eq(orders.orgId, orgId))
);

// ‚ùå BAD - Direct database call (will need refactoring)
import { getDb } from '../db';
const db = await getDb();
const orders = await db.select().from(orders);
```

**Files:**
- `server/_core/dataProvider.ts` - Data access abstraction interface
- All `*Db.ts` files MUST use this interface

**Verification:**
- [ ] No direct `getDb()` calls in new code
- [ ] All data access uses `dataProvider` interface

---

### 13.3 Offline-First API Design

**Rule:** All mutation endpoints MUST return full objects, timestamps, and affected records.

**Why:** Enables optimistic UI updates, conflict resolution, and cache invalidation for offline-first PWA.

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ GOOD - Offline-friendly response
export const ordersRouter = router({
  create: protectedProcedure
    .input(createOrderSchema)
    .mutation(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
      const order = await ordersDb.createOrder(input, ctx.user.organizationId);
      return {
        order,  // Full object for optimistic update
        affectedRecords: {  // For cache invalidation
          orders: [order.id],
          inventory: order.items.map(i => i.inventoryId),
        },
        timestamp: new Date(),  // For conflict resolution
      };
    }),
});

// ‚ùå BAD - Not offline-friendly (requires another query)
export const ordersRouter = router({
  create: protectedProcedure
    .input(createOrderSchema)
    .mutation(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
      const orderId = await ordersDb.createOrder(input);
      return { orderId };  // Client needs to fetch full object!
    }),
});
```

**Required Response Fields:**
- `[resource]`: Full object that was created/updated
- `affectedRecords`: Object mapping resource types to affected IDs
- `timestamp`: ISO timestamp for conflict resolution

**Verification:**
- [ ] Mutation returns full object (not just ID)
- [ ] Response includes `affectedRecords`
- [ ] Response includes `timestamp`

---

### 13.4 Schema Evolution

**Rule:** All schema changes MUST be additive, never breaking.

**Why:** Enables zero-downtime deployments and backward compatibility during the 8-week transition.

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ GOOD - Additive change (backward compatible)
export const users = mysqlTable('users', {
  id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
  email: varchar('email', { length: 255 }).notNull(),
  // ... existing fields ...
  
  // NEW: Nullable for backward compatibility
  mfaEnabled: boolean('mfa_enabled').default(false),
  deviceCertificateRequired: boolean('device_certificate_required').default(false),
});

// ‚ùå BAD - Breaking change (renames field)
export const users = mysqlTable('users', {
  id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
  emailAddress: varchar('email_address', { length: 255 }),  // RENAMED - BREAKS CODE!
});
```

**Rules:**
- **NEVER** rename existing columns (add new ones instead)
- **NEVER** delete existing tables (mark as deprecated instead)
- **ALWAYS** make new fields nullable or provide defaults
- **ALWAYS** use migrations for schema changes

**Verification:**
- [ ] No renamed columns
- [ ] No deleted tables
- [ ] New fields are nullable or have defaults
- [ ] Migration file created

---

### 13.5 Code Organization

**Rule:** Routers THIN (< 50 lines per procedure), Business logic in `*Db.ts` files.

**Why:** Keeps authentication, validation, and business logic separated for easier refactoring.

**File Structure:**

```
server/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _core/                    # Core infrastructure (abstraction layer)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ authProvider.ts       # Authentication abstraction
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dataProvider.ts       # Data access abstraction
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ errors.ts             # Error handling
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logger.ts             # Logging
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ monitoring.ts         # Monitoring
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/                     # Authentication logic (FUTURE: MFA goes here)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (reserved for future)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routers/                  # API endpoints (THIN - just validation & delegation)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orders.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ inventory.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ *Db.ts                    # Business logic (THICK - all logic here)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ordersDb.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ inventoryDb.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/                    # Shared utilities
```

**Router Pattern (THIN):**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ GOOD - Thin router (< 50 lines per procedure)
export const ordersRouter = router({
  create: protectedProcedure
    .input(createOrderSchema)
    .mutation(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
      return await ordersDb.createOrder(input, ctx.user.organizationId);
    }),
});

// ‚ùå BAD - Fat router with business logic
export const ordersRouter = router({
  create: protectedProcedure
    .input(createOrderSchema)
    .mutation(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
      // 100+ lines of business logic here - BAD!
      const db = await getDb();
      const order = await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
        // Complex business logic...
      });
      return order;
    }),
});
```

**Business Logic Pattern (THICK):**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ GOOD - Business logic in ordersDb.ts
export async function createOrder(input: CreateOrderInput, orgId: number) {
  return await dataProvider.transaction(async (tx) => {
    // All business logic here
    // Validation, calculations, database operations
    // Can be 100+ lines - that's fine!
  });
}
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] Router procedures < 50 lines
- [ ] Business logic in `*Db.ts` files
- [ ] No database queries in routers

---

### 13.6 Pre-Push Compatibility Checklist

**MANDATORY:** Before every `git push`, verify:

**Authentication:**
- [ ] Uses `authProvider` interface (not Clerk directly)
- [ ] No direct authentication provider imports in new code

**Data Access:**
- [ ] Uses `dataProvider` interface (not `getDb()` directly)
- [ ] No direct database access in new code

**API Design:**
- [ ] Mutations return full objects (not just IDs)
- [ ] Responses include `affectedRecords`
- [ ] Responses include `timestamp`

**Schema:**
- [ ] Schema changes are additive only
- [ ] No renamed columns or deleted tables
- [ ] New fields are nullable or have defaults
- [ ] Migration file created

**Code Organization:**
- [ ] Router procedures < 50 lines
- [ ] Business logic in `*Db.ts` files
- [ ] No business logic in routers

**Failure to meet these criteria is a protocol violation.**
