# Parallel Wave Execution Report

**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Executor:** TERP PM Agent

## Executive Summary

Successfully executed a parallel wave of work independent of the in-flight inventory filter chain (INV-FILTER-001 through INV-FILTER-004). The wave focused on roadmap hygiene and one genuine implementation task.

## Current In-Flight Work (Protected)

| Task           | Description            | Status            |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| INV-FILTER-001 | Inventory Filter Chain | PR #368 open      |
| INV-FILTER-002 | Filter reconnection    | Dependent on #368 |
| INV-FILTER-003 | Filter UI updates      | Dependent on #368 |
| INV-FILTER-004 | Filter persistence     | Dependent on #368 |

**No changes were made to inventory-related files.**

### Tasks Implemented

| Task ID | Description                  | PR   | Status    |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | ---- | --------- |
| WS-010A | Integrate Photography Module | #373 | ✅ MERGED |

**WS-010A Implementation Details:**

- Added "Upload Photos" button to each queue item
- Integrated PhotographyModule component in dialog
- Wired up onUpload callback to inventory.uploadMedia mutation
- Converts files to base64 for upload
- Marks batch complete with uploaded image URLs after successful upload
- Preserves existing queue functionality

## Roadmap Updates Pushed

1. **Commit `c7afd498`**: Initial parallel wave plan
2. **Commit `59530cbe`**: Updated FE-QA-010 (COMPLETE), WS-010A (IN_PROGRESS)
3. **Commit `dd6e3fbc`**: Marked WS-010A as COMPLETE

All commits used `[skip ci]` to avoid triggering deployments.

## CI Infrastructure Issues Identified

Two CI workflow bugs were discovered:

1. **TypeScript Baseline Check**: Script bug in output processing causes failure even when 0 errors
2. **Quality Gate**: 404 error due to malformed URL (`EvanTenenbaum//issues`)

These should be addressed in a separate infrastructure task.

## Recommended Next Steps

**Primary Recommendation:** Continue with the INV-FILTER chain by reviewing and merging PR #368.

**Justification:** The inventory filter chain is S0-CRITICAL priority and blocking other inventory-related work. With WS-010A complete, the next highest-impact action is unblocking the inventory work.

**Alternative Options:**

1. Fix CI infrastructure bugs (prevents future false failures)
2. Start next parallel wave targeting API-017 (Stock Threshold Configuration)
3. Address FE-QA-011 (Integrate Unused Dashboard Widgets)
