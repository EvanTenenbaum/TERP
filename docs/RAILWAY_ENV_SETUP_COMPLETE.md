## 🎯 Next Steps

You're now ready for **Phase 2: Deploy to Railway**

### What's Ready:
1. ✅ Railway project created
2. ✅ MySQL database provisioned
3. ✅ All critical environment variables set
4. ✅ Railway domain generated
5. ✅ Service linked to database

### What's Next:
1. **Create railway.json** configuration file
2. **Deploy application** to Railway
3. **Run database migrations**
4. **Test deployment**
5. **Verify health checks**

## 🔐 Security Notes

### New Secrets Generated:
```bash
JWT_SECRET=*** (32-byte base64 encoded secret)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=*** (32-byte base64 encoded secret)
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: These are NEW secrets for your Railway dev environment. They are different from your DigitalOcean production secrets. This is intentional and correct - dev and prod should have different secrets.

### Clerk Keys:
Using the same Clerk test keys from DigitalOcean. These are test keys (`pk_test_...` and `sk_test_...`), which is appropriate for a development environment.

## 📝 Optional Variables (Skipped)

These monitoring/logging variables were not migrated because:
1. They're optional for development
2. Values are encrypted in DigitalOcean (can't extract)
3. You can add them later if needed

**Skipped**:
- `SENTRY_DSN` - Error tracking (optional)
- `CRON_SECRET` - Cron job authentication (optional)
- `PAPERTRAIL_ENDPOINT` - Log aggregation (optional)

To add them later:
```bash
railway variables --set SENTRY_DSN="your-sentry-dsn"
railway variables --set CRON_SECRET="your-cron-secret"
railway variables --set PAPERTRAIL_ENDPOINT="your-papertrail-endpoint"
```
