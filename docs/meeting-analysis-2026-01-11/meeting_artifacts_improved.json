(2) Each partial payment is recorded with date, amount, method, and notes. (3) System auto-updates remaining balance and next due date. (4) Visual status indicators: On Track (green), Overdue (red), Paid in Full (blue). (5) Allow manual adjustments, skip/reschedule options, and early payoff.

      "context": "Verification step added but dispute resolution unclear",
      "source_items": ["MEET-065"],
      "status": "RESOLVED",
      "answer": "RECOMMENDATION: Implement a 3-step dispute resolution process: (1) FLAGGING: Person putting away inventory can flag a discrepancy with the original receipt, noting the difference (e.g., 'Receipt says 12 lbs, actual count is 10 lbs'). (2) REVIEW: Flag triggers a notification to admin/manager who reviews the discrepancy with both parties (receipt creator and verifier). (3) RESOLUTION: Admin can either (a) Adjust the receipt to match actual count with audit note, or (b) Confirm original receipt if error was in verification. All changes are logged with timestamp, user, and reason for audit trail. This prevents the '12 pounds off' scenario by catching discrepancies before they become disputes."
