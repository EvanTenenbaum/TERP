![Login screen](./images/login.png)

## 1) Sign In

1. Open the VIP Portal link provided by your TERP admin (usually `https://terp-app-b9s35.ondigitalocean.app/vip-portal`).
2. Enter your email and password, then select **Sign in**.
3. If multifactor authentication is enabled by your organization, complete the prompt.

> **Tip:** If you do not know your credentials, ask your TERP administrator to reset them from the admin console.

## 2) Confirm Access

- After signing in you should land on the **VIP Dashboard**. If you see the login form again, your session token may have expired—sign in once more.
- To switch devices, simply sign in on the new device; sessions automatically expire after 30 days.

## 3) Navigation Basics

- Use the left navigation menu to open **Dashboard**, **Transactions**, **Marketplace**, **Appointments**, or **Documents**.
- The bell icon in the header opens the **Notifications** panel.
- The profile menu lets you **Sign out** or view your client name.

## FAQ

- **Forgot password?** Contact your TERP admin to trigger a reset—self-service resets are disabled for security.
- **Session expired?** Close the tab and sign in again; all data stays saved server-side.
- **Who can see my data?** Only your organization and authorized TERP admins with audit logging enabled.
