3. Click a notification to open the related page (invoice, appointment, or catalog item).

## Manage Read State

- Use **Mark as read** on an item to clear its badge.

## Tips

- Enable email notifications with your TERP admin if you want copies in your inbox.
- Keep notifications clear to avoid missing approvals.

## FAQ

- **Why do I see no items?** You may be caught up, or notifications might be disabled for your client.
- **Links are not working.** Ensure you are logged in; session timeouts can block deep links.
- **Can I turn off a category?** Ask your admin to adjust notification preferences per client.
