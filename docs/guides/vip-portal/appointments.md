## Book a Time

1. Go to **Appointments** from the navigation.
2. Choose a **Calendar** and **Appointment Type** (e.g., "Quarterly Review").
3. Select a date range; available slots appear in a grid.
4. Pick a time and optionally add notes.
5. Submit the request. You will see a confirmation and the request will appear in **My Requests**.

## Manage Requests

- View all requests under **My Requests** with status (pending/approved/declined).
- If you need to adjust the time, cancel the pending request and submit a new one.
- Notifications will alert you when a request is approved or rescheduled.

## Tips

- Slots respect blackout dates and existing events; if a day is empty, no time is available.
- Time zones are handled automatically—slots show in your device timezone.
- Add context in notes to speed up approvals (e.g., order number or topic).

## FAQ

- **I do not see any calendars.** Your admin may not have enabled appointment types for your client.
- **Why was my slot rejected?** It may have been taken by another request; try another time or date.
- **Can I invite teammates?** Include attendees in your notes and your TERP rep will add them to the meeting.
