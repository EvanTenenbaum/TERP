## What You See

- **Balance Cards:** Current AR balance, YTD spend, credit utilization, and active needs/supply counts.
- **Quick Filters:** Search invoices, bills, or transactions from the top search bar.
- **Recent Activity:** Latest invoices, bills, and price alerts.

## Everyday Workflow

1. **Check balances:** Review the AR and AP cards to see what needs attention.
2. **Open details:** Click a card to jump into invoices, bills, or transaction history (opens the relevant list with your filters applied).
3. **Act:** From the destination page you can download documents, request payment arrangements, or message your account team.

## Tips

- Hover tooltips on cards show how numbers are calculated.
- Use the date filters to focus on a billing period.
- If a card is missing, ask your admin to enable the corresponding module in VIP configuration.

## FAQ

- **Why is a card empty?** You may have no data for that metric or the module is disabled for your client.
- **Numbers look outdated.** Refresh the page or check with your admin to ensure overnight sync completed.
- **Can I export this view?** Use the Documents section to export invoices/bills; dashboard exports are planned.
