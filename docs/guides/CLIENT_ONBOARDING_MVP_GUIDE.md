## Welcome to TERP!

We're excited to have you on board. This guide will walk you through the simple, straightforward steps to get your team up and running on your own private and secure TERP instance. Our goal is to tailor the system to your unique workflow, ensuring a smooth transition as you begin using it alongside your current system.

Here’s a non-technical overview of the process.

---

## Step 1: Your Private & Secure TERP Instance

Think of this as building your own private, digital headquarters. Our team will create a dedicated, isolated environment just for you. This means:

- **Your data is completely separate and secure.** No one else can see or access it.
- **The system is yours to customize.** The features and settings you choose won't affect any other client.

This process is handled entirely by our technical team. There's nothing you need to do for this step except give us the green light!

## Step 2: Creating Your Team's Accounts

Once your private instance is ready, we'll create the first "Super Admin" account for you. From there, you'll have full control to invite your team members and manage their access levels.

### User Roles: Simple & Powerful

TERP uses a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system, which is just a fancy way of saying you can create different roles with different permissions. This ensures that team members only see and do what's relevant to their job.

You can create roles like:

- **Sales Rep:** Can create orders and view client information, but can't see financial reports.
- **Warehouse Manager:** Can manage inventory and process shipments, but can't change system settings.
- **Accountant:** Can manage invoices and payments, but can't edit inventory.

This is all managed through a simple interface in the **Settings > Users & Roles** section. You can create as many roles as you need and assign permissions with simple checkboxes.

## Step 3: Tailoring TERP to Your Workflow (Feature Flags)

TERP is designed to be flexible. You can turn major features and even entire modules on or off to match your business needs. This is done through a system called "Feature Flags." It's like a control panel for your ERP.

Here are some of the key features you can enable or disable for your MVP rollout:

| Feature | What it Does (in simple terms) |
|---|---|
| **Accounting Module** | Enables financial tools like invoicing, payments, and reporting. | 
| **Inventory Module** | Enables inventory tracking, batch management, and COGS calculation. |
| **Sales Module** | Enables order creation, sales sheets, and customer management. |
| **VIP Portal** | A self-service portal for your clients to view products and place orders. |
| **Calendar Module** | A shared calendar for scheduling appointments, deliveries, and team events. |
| **Spreadsheet View** | The new, powerful spreadsheet interface for managing inventory and orders. |
| **Pick & Pack** | A guided workflow for your warehouse team to fulfill orders accurately. |
| **Live Shopping** | Host real-time sales events for your clients. |
| **Leaderboard** | A fun way to track sales performance and motivate your team. |

During onboarding, we'll work with you to decide which of these features you want to start with. You can always turn more on later as you grow!

## Step 4: "Supersizing" Your System (Customization)

Beyond turning features on and off, you can "supersize" your TERP instance by customizing the core data that makes your business unique. This is all done through the **Settings** menu, with no technical knowledge required.

### Key Customization Areas:

- **Locations:** Define all your physical locations, like warehouses, storefronts, or processing facilities. This is crucial for accurate inventory tracking.

- **Product Categories:** Create your own product hierarchy (e.g., "Flower", "Edibles", "Concentrates"). This helps with organization and reporting.

- **Product Grades:** Define your quality tiers (e.g., "A Grade", "B Grade", "Trim").

- **Pricing Profiles:** Create different pricing levels for different types of customers (e.g., "Wholesale", "Retail", "VIP").

- **Notification Preferences:** Each user can decide which email and in-app notifications they want to receive, reducing noise and keeping everyone focused.

- **VIP Portal Configuration:** If you enable the VIP Portal, you can customize its appearance and the products it displays.
