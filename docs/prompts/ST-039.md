# ST-039: Mega QA - Visual Regression Snapshots (Deterministic)

## Context

Visual regression catches layout/UX breaks that functional tests can miss. Snapshots must be deterministic against seeded data.

## Implementation Guide

- Choose 8–12 snapshot states with stable data:
  - dashboard, key lists, create forms, analytics, VIP portal
- Capture theme variants where relevant (light/dark).
- Store snapshot outputs as artifacts referenced from the Mega QA bundle.
- Integrate with existing visual tooling where appropriate, but keep the Mega QA report as the canonical evidence index.

## Acceptance Notes (for AI-only review)

- Snapshot diffs must be attributable to a named state and include artifact pointers.
