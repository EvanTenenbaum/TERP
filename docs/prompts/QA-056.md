# QA-056: Implement Advanced Todo List Features

**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Effort:** 15-20h
**Status:** Not Started

---

## Task Description

Implement the missing advanced features for the Todo Lists & Tasks module. Basic functionality is present but key collaborative features are missing.

## Problem

The Todo List module is not suitable for team collaboration. Users cannot assign tasks, create subtasks, or share lists, limiting its utility to personal task management.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can assign tasks to other team members.
- [ ] Users can create and manage subtasks.
- [ ] Users can view the activity history of a task.
- [ ] A dashboard widget for todos is implemented.
- [ ] Users can share lists with other users.

## Implementation Guide

1.  **Database:**
    -   Add a `userId` to the `tasks` table to support assignments.
    -   Add a `parentId` to the `tasks` table to support subtasks.
    -   Create a `task_history` table to log changes.
2.  **Backend:**
    -   Update the `tasks` router with procedures to assign tasks, create subtasks, and get task history.
3.  **Frontend:**
    -   Update the task detail view to include assignment and subtask functionality.
    -   Create a new component to display task history.
    -   Create a new dashboard widget for todos.

## Verification

-   Create a task and assign it to another user.
-   Create a subtask for an existing task.
-   Verify that the task history is updated when a task is modified.
