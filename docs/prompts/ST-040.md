# ST-040: Mega QA - Resilience / Chaos Suite (Offline, Slow, 500s)

## Context

Mega QA must validate graceful degradation and no corruption under adverse network/server conditions.

## Implementation Guide

- Implement network condition scenarios:
  - offline submissions
  - slow network profiles
  - injected 500 responses for selected endpoints
- Validate UX behaviors:
  - error toasts/alerts
  - no crash
  - retries/backoff where appropriate
- Validate data behaviors:
  - failed mutations do not partially persist corrupt state
- Emit structured resilience results and artifacts into the report bundle.

## Acceptance Notes (for AI-only review)

- Failures must show injected condition + affected endpoint + observed UI state.
