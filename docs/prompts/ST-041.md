# ST-041: Mega QA - Soak / Stability Runner (Timeboxed)

## Context

Some issues (leaks, pool exhaustion) appear only over time. Mega QA should include an optional soak mode for RC/nightly.

## Implementation Guide

- Add a soak mode to the Mega QA runner:
  - timeboxed execution loop
  - small set of critical flows repeated
  - failure stops the run and captures artifacts
- Track soak metrics:
  - iteration count
  - time to first failure
  - failure rate
  - key error classes
- Emit a machine summary into the report bundle.

## Acceptance Notes (for AI-only review)

- Soak runs must be deterministic in configuration and produce a clear stop reason.
