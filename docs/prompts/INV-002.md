# INV-002: Enhance Inventory View with Product Context

## Implementation Guide

### Problem

After removing Products page, users need to see product information inline with inventory items.

### Solution

Ensure the Inventory page shows:

1. Product name, category, brand, strain prominently
2. Ability to edit product metadata from batch view
3. Clear labeling ("Item" instead of "Batch" for user-facing)

### Current State

The enhanced API already returns product info:

- `productName`, `category`, `subcategory`, `brandName`

The Inventory.tsx already displays this in columns.

### Enhancements Needed

1. **Terminology Update:** Change "Batch" labels to "Item" or "Inventory Item"
2. **Product Edit:** Add button in BatchDetailDrawer to edit product name/category
3. **Product Creation:** When creating intake without matching product, auto-create

### Files to Modify

- `client/src/pages/Inventory.tsx` - Terminology updates
- `client/src/components/inventory/BatchDetailDrawer.tsx` - Add product edit
- `server/routers/inventory.ts` - Add product update mutation if needed

### Acceptance Criteria

- Users see all product info in inventory view
- Can edit product metadata without leaving inventory
- Terminology is consistent ("Item" or "Inventory Item")

### Estimate
