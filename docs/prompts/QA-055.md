# QA-055: Fix Help & Documentation Search

**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Effort:** 8-12h
**Status:** Not Started

---

## Task Description

Fix the broken search functionality in the Help & Documentation center. The search bar currently exists but is non-functional, failing to return any results.

## Problem

The Help Center is unusable for self-service support because users cannot find relevant articles. This increases the burden on support staff and frustrates users.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The search bar on the Help Center page returns relevant articles.
- [ ] Search queries are not case-sensitive.
- [ ] The search indexes both the titles and content of help articles.
- [ ] A dedicated section for video tutorials is added.

## Implementation Guide

1.  **Backend:**
    -   Implement a tRPC procedure `searchHelpArticles` that takes a search query and returns a list of matching articles.
    -   This can be implemented with a simple `LIKE` query or a more advanced full-text search solution.
2.  **Frontend:**
    -   In the Help Center component, connect the search bar to the `searchHelpArticles` procedure.
    -   Display the search results dynamically as the user types.

## Verification

-   Navigate to the Help Center.
-   Search for a known term (e.g., "pricing") and verify that relevant articles are returned.
-   Verify that the search is case-insensitive.
