    -   Implement tRPC procedures to update these settings.
2.  **Frontend:**
    -   In the client profile, add a new tab for VIP Portal configuration.
    -   Build out the UI for uploading a logo and selecting colors.
    -   Implement the form to configure ordering permissions.

## Verification

-   Upload a logo for a client and verify it appears on their VIP Portal.
-   Change the primary color and verify the change is reflected.
-   Adjust ordering permissions and verify they are enforced.
