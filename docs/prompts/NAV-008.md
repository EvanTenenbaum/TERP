# NAV-008: Promote Todo Lists in Navigation

## Implementation Guide

### Problem

Todo Lists is currently buried in the Admin group. For a task management system to be useful, it needs to be prominently visible.

### Solution

Either:

1. Move Todo Lists to its own top-level section
2. Add "My Tasks" widget to dashboard header
3. Add "My Tasks" count badge to sidebar

### Files to Modify

- `client/src/config/navigation.ts`
- Optional: `client/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`

### Implementation

```typescript
// Option 1: Move to Sales group (more visible)
{
  name: "Tasks",
  path: "/todos",
  icon: CheckSquare,
  group: "sales", // Move from "admin" to "sales"
  ariaLabel: "Personal and team task management",
},
```

### Acceptance Criteria

- Todo Lists is more visible in navigation
- Users can quickly see if they have pending tasks
- Task count badge shows assigned tasks (optional enhancement)

### Estimate

2 hours
