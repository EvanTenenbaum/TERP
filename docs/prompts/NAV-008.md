# NAV-008: Promote Todo Lists in Navigation

## Implementation Guide

### Problem

Todo Lists is currently in the Admin group (lines 157-163 of `navigation.ts`):

```typescript
// NAV-005: Added Todo Lists for task management
{
  name: "Todo Lists",
  path: "/todos",
  icon: CheckSquare,
  group: "admin",  // <-- Buried in Admin, after System Settings and Calendar
  ariaLabel: "Personal task management and todo lists",
},
```

For a task management system to be useful, it needs to be prominently visible. Currently it's the 4th item in the Admin group.

### Solution Options

| Option          | Approach                       | Pros                      | Cons                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| A (Recommended) | Move to Sales group            | Most visible, first group | May seem out of place |
| B               | Rename to "My Tasks" + badge   | Clear purpose             | More complex          |
| C               | Create "Tasks" top-level group | Best organization         | Bigger change         |

### Files to Modify

| File                              | Location      | Change                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `client/src/config/navigation.ts` | Lines 157-163 | Change `group: "admin"` to `group: "sales"` |
| `client/src/config/navigation.ts` | Same block    | Optionally rename to "My Tasks"             |

### Implementation (Option A)

**Edit lines 156-163:**

```typescript
  // NAV-005/NAV-008: Promoted Todo Lists for better visibility
  {
    name: "My Tasks",  // Renamed for clarity
    path: "/todos",
    icon: CheckSquare,
    group: "sales",  // Changed from "admin" to "sales"
    ariaLabel: "Personal and team task management",
  },
```

### Future Enhancement

Add unread task count badge:

```typescript
// In Sidebar.tsx, query user's pending tasks and display badge
const { data: taskCount } = trpc.todoTasks.getMyPendingCount.useQuery();
```

### Verification

```bash
# 1. Verify change
grep -A5 "Todo Lists\|My Tasks" client/src/config/navigation.ts

# 2. Verify group assignment
grep -B2 -A5 '"/todos"' client/src/config/navigation.ts

# 3. Visual verification - should appear in Sales group now
pnpm dev
```

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Todo Lists/My Tasks appears in Sales group (first nav group)
- [ ] Appears near the top of visible navigation
- [ ] No broken links or routing issues
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
