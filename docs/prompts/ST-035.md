# ST-035: Mega QA - Property-Based Fuzz Tests for Core Business Logic

## Context

Property-based testing finds edge cases that scripted flows miss, producing minimized repro inputs for AI debugging.

## Implementation Guide

- Use `fast-check` to define 3–5 property suites (pricing, inventory moves, accounting transitions, AR aging).
- Encode invariants as properties (must always hold).
- Ensure failing cases are minimized and include:
  - RNG seed
  - minimized input payload
  - expected invariant vs actual result
- Emit results into Mega QA report bundle.

## Acceptance Notes (for AI-only review)

- Property failures must be replayable via seed + minimized payload.
