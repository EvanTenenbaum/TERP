# ST-028: Mega QA - Machine-Readable Report Bundle Schema + Writer

## Context

Mega QA is AI-consumed only. We need a structured report bundle that preserves replayability and evidence beyond Playwright’s default JSON.

## Implementation Guide

- Define a stable bundle directory structure under `qa-results/mega-qa/<run-id>/`.
- Implement a report writer module (e.g. `scripts/mega-qa/reporting/writeBundle.ts`) that emits:
  - `manifest.json` (git SHA, timestamps, baseURL, scenario, seeds, runner version)
  - `coverage.json` (required/hit/waived tags)
  - `failures.json` (per-failure replay inputs + artifact pointers)
  - `artifacts.json` (trace/screenshot/video paths + hashes if useful)
- Ensure every failing test/journey records:
  - persona
  - journey seed (if applicable)
  - step transcript (action list)
  - URL history
  - key network failures (request/response metadata)
  - console errors
- Add a `latest-report.json` pointer or copy for easy retrieval.

## Acceptance Notes (for AI-only review)

- A failure must be replayable using only `failures.json` + artifacts.
- The schema must be versioned (e.g., `schemaVersion` in manifest).
