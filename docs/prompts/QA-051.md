# QA-051: Implement Analytics & Reporting Backend

**Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Effort:** 40-60h
**Status:** Not Started

---

## Task Description

Implement the backend functionality for the Analytics & Reporting module. The UI currently exists as a placeholder and is non-functional.

## Problem

The entire Analytics module is a stub. The Sales, Inventory, and Client analytics sections display a "Feature In Development" message. This is a critical gap in the product's functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Backend endpoints are created for Sales, Inventory, and Client analytics.
- [ ] Data is correctly aggregated from the database.
- [ ] The frontend is connected to the new backend endpoints.
- [ ] Basic data visualizations (charts, graphs) are functional.
- [ ] Date range filtering is implemented.
- [ ] Export to CSV functionality is implemented.

## Implementation Guide

1.  **Backend:**
    -   Create a new router `server/routers/analytics.ts`.
    -   Implement tRPC procedures for `getSalesAnalytics`, `getInventoryAnalytics`, and `getClientAnalytics`.
    -   These procedures should query the database and return aggregated data.
2.  **Frontend:**
    -   In `client/src/pages/AnalyticsPage.tsx`, replace the placeholder content with actual data fetching and visualization components.
    -   Use a charting library (e.g., Recharts) to display the data.
    -   Implement date range pickers and connect them to the backend queries.

## Verification

-   Navigate to the Analytics page.
-   Verify that sales, inventory, and client data is displayed.
-   Test date range filtering.
-   Test CSV export.
