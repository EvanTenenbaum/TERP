# QA-063: Implement Location & Warehouse Management

**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Effort:** 15-20h
**Status:** Not Started

---

## Task Description

Implement the missing functionality for Location & Warehouse Management. Currently, there is no way to add new locations or assign inventory to them.

## Problem

Inventory management is incomplete without location tracking. Warehouse managers cannot organize inventory, which leads to inefficiencies and potential errors.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can add, edit, and delete warehouse locations.
- [ ] Users can assign inventory batches to specific locations.
- [ ] Users can view inventory by location.

## Implementation Guide

1.  **Database:**
    -   Create a `locations` table.
    -   Add a `locationId` to the `inventory_batches` table.
2.  **Backend:**
    -   Create a `locations` router with procedures to manage locations.
    -   Update the `inventory` router to support location assignment.
3.  **Frontend:**
    -   Create a new page for managing locations.
    -   In the inventory batch detail view, add a dropdown to assign a location.

## Verification

-   Create a new location.
-   Assign an inventory batch to the new location.
-   Filter the inventory list by location and verify the results.
