# QA-065: Implement Missing Dashboard Features

**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Effort:** 6-8h
**Status:** Not Started

---

## Task Description

Implement the missing features on the main dashboard, including the "Scratch pad" and the "Quick Action Search".

## Problem

The dashboard is missing some of its intended functionality, which reduces its utility as a central hub for users.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The "Scratch pad" feature is implemented, allowing users to take quick notes.
- [ ] The "Quick Action Search" is fixed to be a true command palette that returns immediate results without navigating to a new page.

## Implementation Guide

1.  **Scratch Pad:**
    -   Add a new component for the scratch pad.
    -   Use local storage or a new database table to persist the notes.
2.  **Quick Action Search:**
    -   Refactor the search component to be an overlay or modal.
    -   Implement a backend procedure that returns a variety of entities (clients, orders, products) based on the search query.

## Verification

-   Use the scratch pad to take a note and verify it persists after a page reload.
-   Use the quick action search and verify that it returns a list of relevant results in an overlay.
