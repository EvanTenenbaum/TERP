# QA-057: Implement CRM Sub-Features

**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Effort:** 20-30h
**Status:** Not Started

---

## Task Description

Implement the missing sub-features for the Clients & CRM module. While the core client entity exists, all relationship management functionality is missing.

## Problem

The CRM is currently just a list of clients. It lacks the features necessary to manage client relationships, track interactions, and configure client-specific settings.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can set and manage credit limits for clients.
- [ ] Users can assign pricing profiles to clients.
- [ ] Users can add and view communication logs.
- [ ] Users can schedule meetings with clients.
- [ ] Users can view the purchase history of a client.

## Implementation Guide

1.  **Database:**
    -   Add `creditLimit` and `pricingProfileId` columns to the `clients` table.
    -   Create a `communication_logs` table.
2.  **Backend:**
    -   Update the `clients` router with procedures to update credit limits, assign pricing profiles, and manage communication logs.
3.  **Frontend:**
    -   In the client profile page, add new tabs or sections for credit, pricing, and communications.
    -   Build out the UI for each of these new features.

## Verification

-   Open a client profile.
-   Set a credit limit and verify it saves.
-   Assign a pricing profile and verify it saves.
-   Add a communication log and verify it appears in the client's history.
