# ST-043: Mega QA - Bugpackager (Convert Mega QA Failures to Roadmap-Ready Inputs)

## Context

Mega QA must output bug-ready objects with replay commands and evidence pointers, optimized for AI-only readers and easy conversion into `BUG-XXX` roadmap entries.

## Implementation Guide

- Define a normalized failure object schema (test/journey id, suite, tags, seed/persona, errors, artifact pointers).
- Implement a converter that:
  - reads the Mega QA bundle (`failures.json`, `manifest.json`)
  - produces a `bug-candidates.json` suitable for roadmap/prompt generation
- Integrate with existing QA pipeline (`scripts/qa/*`) by:
  - keeping `test-results.json` compatibility
  - optionally extending the pipeline to ingest `bug-candidates.json` for richer prompts
- Ensure generated bug prompts include:
  - exact replay command
  - bundle path
  - failure id
  - artifacts list

## Acceptance Notes (for AI-only review)

- A generated bug must contain everything needed to reproduce without additional context.
