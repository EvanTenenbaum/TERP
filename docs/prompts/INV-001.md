# INV-001: Remove Products Page from Navigation

## Implementation Guide

### Problem

Users think in terms of "Inventory Items" (batches), not "Products" (templates).

| User Mental Model               | System Model                             | Result                     |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| "I have 50 units of Blue Dream" | Product = template, Batch = actual units | Confusion                  |
| "This SKU is sold out"          | Batch qty = 0, but Product still exists  | "Why is it still showing?" |

**Current navigation** (`client/src/config/navigation.ts:93`):

```typescript
{ name: "Products", path: "/products", icon: Package, group: "inventory" },
```

### Business Context

| Fact                                     | Implication                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| SKUs are NEVER reordered                 | Product page serves no reordering purpose |
| Each intake = new batch = new unique SKU | Product is just metadata template         |
| When batch qty hits 0, it's done forever | No need to track products separately      |
| Products are auto-created during intake  | Users don't manually create products      |

### Solution

Remove Products from navigation. Keep route for admin access.

### Files to Modify

| File                              | Location | Change                |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------- |
| `client/src/config/navigation.ts` | Line 93  | Remove Products entry |

### Implementation

```typescript
// client/src/config/navigation.ts - Line 93
// DELETE OR COMMENT THIS LINE:
{ name: "Products", path: "/products", icon: Package, group: "inventory" },
```

### Verification

```bash
# 1. Verify entry removed
grep -n "Products" client/src/config/navigation.ts

# 2. Verify route still works
pnpm dev  # Navigate to /products directly
```

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Products not visible in sidebar
- [ ] Route `/products` still works
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
