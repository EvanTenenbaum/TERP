# INV-001: Remove Products Page from Navigation

## Implementation Guide

### Problem

Users think in terms of "Inventory Items" (batches), not "Products" (templates).

- Products page manages product definitions
- But products are auto-created during intake
- The Products page is redundant for the workflow

### Business Context

- SKUs are NEVER reordered
- Each intake = new batch = new unique SKU
- When batch qty hits 0, it's done forever
- Products are just metadata templates, not user-facing entities

### Solution

Remove Products from navigation. Product management happens:

1. Automatically during intake (find-or-create)
2. Inline within Inventory view (edit product metadata on batch)

### Files to Modify

- `client/src/config/navigation.ts` - Remove Products entry

### Implementation

```typescript
// Remove this entry (around line 93):
// { name: "Products", path: "/products", icon: Package, group: "inventory" },
```

### Optional Enhancements

1. Add inline product editing in BatchDetailDrawer
2. Auto-create product if it doesn't exist during intake

### Acceptance Criteria

- Products page no longer in navigation
- Route `/products` still works (for direct links)
- No broken links elsewhere in app

### Estimate

1 hour
