# ST-023: Stabilize Deploy-Time Data Operations (Seeding + Post-Deploy Job)

## Implementation Guide

This task ensures production deployments are not destabilized by implicit data mutation scripts:

- Seeding must **never** run implicitly on web startup (import/bundle side-effects).
- Post-deploy augmentation must be invoked via a **single entrypoint** (avoid `&&` / shell parsing in DigitalOcean job `run_command`).

### Steps

1. Make seeding library code import-safe (no auto-run blocks).
2. Provide explicit runner scripts / package scripts for seeding.
3. Provide a single `augment-data` job entrypoint script that runs required sub-scripts in sequence.
4. Update deployment/job configuration to call only the entrypoint.

### Verification

- Deploy web service and confirm startup succeeds without executing seeding.
- Trigger augmentation entrypoint manually (or as a job) and confirm it runs without `pnpm` argument parsing errors.
