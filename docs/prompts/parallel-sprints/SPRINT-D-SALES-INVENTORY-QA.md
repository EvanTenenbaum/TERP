# 🟣 Sprint D: Sales, Inventory & Quality Assurance

---

## Agent Identity & Context

You are an AI agent working on TERP, a cannabis ERP system. Your prime directive: **Leave the code better than you found it.**

You are assigned to execute **Sprint D** of the TERP ERP parallel sprint plan. This sprint focuses on Sales workflows, Inventory management, and Quality Assurance (testing & documentation). You will work in parallel with two other agents (Sprint B and Sprint C) who are working on different file domains.

---

## Before ANY Work

1. Read `UNIVERSAL_AGENT_RULES.md` for complete protocols
2. Pull latest: `git pull origin main`
3. Check active sessions: `cat docs/ACTIVE_SESSIONS.md`
4. Check roadmap: `cat docs/roadmaps/MASTER_ROADMAP.md`
5. Register your session (mandatory)
6. **Verify Sprint A is complete** - Schema must be stable

---

## Critical Rules (NEVER BREAK)

- ❌ **NO `any` types** - Use proper TypeScript types always
- ❌ **NO skipping tests** - TDD is mandatory (write tests BEFORE code)
- ❌ **NO editing files another agent is working on** - Check ACTIVE_SESSIONS.md
- ❌ **NO editing files outside your Sprint D domain** - See File Ownership below
- ❌ **NO marking tasks complete without deployment verification**
- ❌ **NO committing without validation** - Run `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test`

---

## Session Registration (MANDATORY)

Before starting work:
```bash
SESSION_ID="Session-$(date +%Y%m%d)-SPRINT-D-$(openssl rand -hex 3)"
# Create docs/sessions/active/$SESSION_ID.md
# Add to docs/ACTIVE_SESSIONS.md
# Commit and push IMMEDIATELY
```

---

## Development Standards

### TypeScript
- Explicit return types on all functions
- Use type guards, not assertions
- Handle null/undefined explicitly

### React
- Use `React.memo` for reusable components
- Use `useCallback` for event handlers
- Use `useMemo` for expensive computations

### Testing
- Write tests BEFORE implementation (TDD)
- 80%+ coverage for business logic
- Test behavior, not implementation

### Database
- snake_case for tables/columns
- Index ALL foreign keys
- Use soft deletes (`is_deleted`)

---

## Git Workflow

```bash
git pull origin main                           # Always pull first
git checkout -b sprint-d/sales-inventory-qa    # Your sprint branch
git commit -m "feat(scope): description"       # Conventional commits
git push origin sprint-d/sales-inventory-qa    # Push after each phase
```

---

## Deployment

**Platform**: DigitalOcean App Platform
**URL**: https://terp-app-b9s35.ondigitalocean.app

```bash
git push origin main                           # Triggers deployment (after merge)
bash scripts/watch-deploy.sh                   # Monitor
curl https://terp-app-b9s35.ondigitalocean.app/health  # Verify
```
