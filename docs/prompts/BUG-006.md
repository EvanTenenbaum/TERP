## Context

**Problem:**
The Workflow Queue page rendered a Kanban board, but there was no way to add batches/items into the queue, making the workflow system unusable.

**Goal:**
Provide a clear “add to queue” entry point so users can select batches and assign an initial workflow status.

## Implementation Guide

### Key areas to review

- `server/routers/workflow-queue.ts`: endpoints for listing eligible batches and adding them to the queue
- `client/src/pages/WorkflowQueuePage.tsx`: UI entry point + batch selection dialog

### Checklist

1. **Backend**
   - Create an endpoint to list batches not yet in the queue (e.g., missing `statusId`)
   - Create an endpoint to add one or many batches to the queue with an initial status

2. **Frontend**
   - Add a clear “Add to Queue” CTA in the workflow queue UI
   - Provide a searchable multi-select dialog for batches
   - Let user pick the initial workflow column/status

3. **Validation**
   - Manual smoke: add 1+ batches to queue and verify they appear in the Kanban board
   - Confirm permissions / errors are handled cleanly
