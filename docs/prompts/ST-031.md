# ST-031: Mega QA - 100+ Seeded Randomized Journeys (Coverage-Biased)

## Context

We want breadth and depth beyond deterministic tests. Journeys must be seeded, reproducible, and coverage-biased until the contract is satisfied.

## Implementation Guide

- Implement a journey runner under `tests-e2e/mega/journeys/` using a model-based approach:
  - state machine (auth state, persona, current module, entity context)
  - action library mapped to coverage tags
  - guard conditions to avoid invalid actions
- Ensure each journey records:
  - journey seed
  - persona (admin/standard/VIP/logged-out)
  - step transcript (actions + selectors + URLs)
  - coverage tags hit
- Add a bias mechanism:
  - prefer actions that hit uncovered required tags
  - optionally generate directed journeys for stubborn uncovered tags
- Time-bound each journey and fail fast on spinner/crash detection (uses ST-032 oracles).

## Acceptance Notes (for AI-only review)

- Journeys must be replayable using seed + persona + transcript.
- No self-healing; selector failures are evidence, not patched automatically.
