## Implementation Guide

### Problem
Backups without restore drills are an unknown risk; 99.99 reliability requires tested recovery.

### Solution
- Create DR runbook (backup frequency/retention, restore steps, RPO/RTO targets).
- Implement staging restore validation that:
  - restores snapshot
  - runs reconciliation report mode
  - records results and timestamps

### Deliverables
- `docs/reliability/DR_RUNBOOK.md` (backup/restore procedures)
- Automated staging restore validation script/workflow
- Post-restore reconciliation must pass (or produce actionable report)
- Record of drill results and timestamps
- Backout/rollback checklist included

### Acceptance Criteria
- DR runbook exists and references reconciliation checks.
- A restore validation can be executed repeatably and produces a pass/fail report.
