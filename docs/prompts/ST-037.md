# ST-037: Mega QA - Performance Budgets Suite (UI + API)

## Context

Mega QA must prevent performance regressions in key screens and critical backend procedures.

## Implementation Guide

- Define performance budgets for 8–10 screens (dashboard, lists, search, checkout/order create, analytics).
- Define backend latency budgets for 5–10 procedures.
- Measure:
  - page navigation and “settled” time
  - key interactions (search autocomplete, list filter)
  - API timings from captured network metadata
- Emit raw measurements and summarized pass/fail into the report bundle.

## Acceptance Notes (for AI-only review)

- Performance failures must show which budget was exceeded and by how much.
