# QA-064: Fix Credit Management Dashboard Widgets

**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Effort:** 8-12h
**Status:** Not Started

---

## Task Description

Fix the broken and missing dashboard widgets for Credit Management. The "Client Debt Leaderboard" and "Total Debt" widgets are not functional.

## Problem

Credit managers cannot get a quick overview of the credit situation from the dashboard. This forces them to manually run reports and slows down their workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The "Client Debt Leaderboard" widget is implemented and displays the clients with the highest outstanding debt.
- [ ] The "Total Debt" widget is fixed and correctly displays the total outstanding debt across all clients.

## Implementation Guide

1.  **Backend:**
    -   Create tRPC procedures to fetch the data for both widgets.
2.  **Frontend:**
    -   In the dashboard component, connect the widgets to the new backend procedures.
    -   Ensure the data is displayed correctly and updates automatically.

## Verification

-   Navigate to the dashboard.
-   Verify that the "Client Debt Leaderboard" and "Total Debt" widgets display accurate data.
