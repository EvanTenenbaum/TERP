# ST-042: Mega QA - Security + RBAC Negative Matrix Suite

## Context

Mega QA must prove server-side authorization and input-hardening, not just “hidden buttons”.

## Implementation Guide

- Define a representative RBAC matrix (roles × actions) for 10–15 sensitive actions.
- Implement tests that assert:
  - UI hides/blocks where appropriate
  - server rejects unauthorized attempts (capture error payload)
- Add targeted input-hardening probes for high-risk inputs (search/filter/mutations):
  - injection-like strings
  - oversized payloads
  - malformed enums/status transitions
- Emit security suite outputs into the report bundle (action, role, expected denial, observed denial).

## Acceptance Notes (for AI-only review)

- Evidence must include server rejection details (not just UI state).
