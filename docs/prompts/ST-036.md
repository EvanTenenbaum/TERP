# ST-036: Mega QA - Concurrency / Race Condition Suite

## Context

Concurrency bugs require explicit multi-actor testing (two users, simultaneous mutations).

## Implementation Guide

- Choose 3–5 concurrency scenarios:
  - concurrent order creation against same inventory
  - concurrent inventory adjustments
  - concurrent payment recording / invoice settlement
- Implement using:
  - multiple Playwright browser contexts, or
  - parallel API calls with precise ordering
- Assert correctness:
  - no double-decrement, no duplicate side-effects, consistent final state
- Capture timing/ordering metadata in the report bundle.

## Acceptance Notes (for AI-only review)

- Failures must include exact concurrency scenario + ordering + evidence for replay.
