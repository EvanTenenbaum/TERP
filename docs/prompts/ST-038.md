# ST-038: Mega QA - Accessibility Gate (Axe + Keyboard-Only)

## Context

Accessibility needs to be a release gate. Mega QA should emit structured, actionable a11y violations for AI triage.

## Implementation Guide

- Expand Axe coverage using `@axe-core/playwright` on key pages and states (including modals/overlays).
- Add keyboard-only navigation checks for critical interactions (command palette, dialogs, primary forms).
- Emit:
  - violations list (rule id, nodes, selectors)
  - page URL/state identifier
  - artifact pointers (screenshot/trace)

## Acceptance Notes (for AI-only review)

- A11y failures must be machine-parsable and attributable to a page/state.
