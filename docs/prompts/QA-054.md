# QA-054: Implement Vendor Supply Management Backend

**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Effort:** 25-35h
**Status:** Not Started

---

## Task Description

Implement the backend functionality for the Vendor Supply Management module, including the AI matching service. The module is currently non-functional and causes a fatal application error.

## Problem

The core feature of matching vendor supply to client needs is completely broken. Clicking "Find Matches" results in an application crash. The architectural work to unify vendors into supplier profiles is complete, but the service layer that uses this new model is missing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A functional form for submitting vendor supply is implemented.
- [ ] The AI Matchmaking Service is implemented to match supply with client needs.
- [ ] The fatal application error is resolved.
- [ ] The frontend is connected to the new backend service.
- [ ] Matches are displayed with confidence scores.

## Implementation Guide

1.  **Backend:**
    -   Create a new service `server/services/supplyMatchingService.ts`.
    -   Implement a tRPC procedure `findMatches` that takes a supply item and returns a list of matching client needs.
    -   The service should leverage the new `supplier_profiles` table.
    -   Fix the root cause of the application error.
2.  **Frontend:**
    -   In the Vendor Supply component, refactor the "Find Matches" button to call the new `findMatches` procedure.
    -   Display the returned matches in a table or list.

## Verification

-   Submit a new vendor supply item.
-   Click "Find Matches" and verify that a list of client needs is returned without crashing the application.
-   Verify that the matches are relevant to the submitted supply.
