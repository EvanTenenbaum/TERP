# QA-052: Implement System Settings Backend

**Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Effort:** 20-30h
**Status:** Not Started

---

## Task Description

Implement the backend functionality for the System Settings module. The page is currently an empty shell with no configurable options.

## Problem

The System Settings page is a placeholder. Administrators have no way to configure the system, including company information, system defaults, integrations, or notifications.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Backend endpoints are created to get and update system settings.
- [ ] A new database table `system_settings` is created to store settings.
- [ ] The frontend is connected to the new backend endpoints.
- [ ] Users can update company information.
- [ ] Users can configure system defaults (currency, time zone).
- [ ] A mechanism to save changes is implemented and functional.

## Implementation Guide

1.  **Database:**
    -   Create a new table `system_settings` in `drizzle/schema.ts` with columns for company name, address, currency, time zone, etc.
2.  **Backend:**
    -   Create a new router `server/routers/settings.ts`.
    -   Implement tRPC procedures `getSystemSettings` and `updateSystemSettings`.
3.  **Frontend:**
    -   In `client/src/pages/Settings.tsx`, build out the form with fields for all settings.
    -   Use `useAppMutation` and `FormSubmitButton` to handle form submission.
    -   Fetch initial settings on page load.

## Verification

-   Navigate to the Settings page.
-   Update company information and save.
-   Reload the page and verify the changes have persisted.
