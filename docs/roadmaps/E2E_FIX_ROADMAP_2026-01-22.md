# E2E Test Fix Roadmap - January 22, 2026

## Executive Summary

This roadmap addresses 15 issues discovered during comprehensive E2E frontend testing. Analysis reveals:

- **7 route/404 issues** are caused by legacy URL paths (navigation already uses correct paths)
- **4 data display issues** require backend/frontend fixes
- **3 functionality issues** require component-level fixes
- **1 authentication issue** requires router investigation

## Root Cause Analysis

### Systemic Issue 1: Legacy Route Paths

The E2E tester used legacy paths (`/invoices`, `/ar-ap`, `/reports`, etc.) that don't exist in the current routing. The navigation config uses correct paths (`/accounting/invoices`, `/accounting`, `/analytics`, etc.). **Solution**: Add redirect routes for backward compatibility.

### Systemic Issue 2: Data Display Gaps

Orders, Inventory, and Vendors pages show "no data" despite seeded records. This is likely due to:

- MySQL boolean handling (isDraft stored as TINYINT)
- Vendor data not being populated in inventory items
- Query filter mismatches

### Systemic Issue 3: Event Handler Bug (C-01)

The "View Full Profile" button in ClientsWorkSurface may have event propagation issues causing the Archive dialog to trigger incorrectly.

## Strategic Execution Plan

### Wave 1: Route Redirects (7 issues) - PRIORITY: HIGH - COMPLETE

Add legacy route redirects for backward compatibility.

| Issue | Legacy Path        | Correct Path              | Status      |
| ----- | ------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------- |
| C-03  | `/invoices`        | `/accounting/invoices`    | ✅ Complete |
| C-04  | `/client-needs`    | `/needs`                  | ✅ Complete |
| C-07  | `/ar-ap`           | `/accounting`             | ✅ Complete |
| C-08  | `/reports`         | `/analytics`              | ✅ Complete |
| C-09  | `/pricing-rules`   | `/pricing/rules`          | ✅ Complete |
| C-10  | `/system-settings` | `/settings`               | ✅ Complete |
| C-11  | `/feature-flags`   | `/settings/feature-flags` | ✅ Complete |

### Wave 2: Data Display Issues (4 issues) - PRIORITY: HIGH - INVESTIGATION COMPLETE

**Root Cause: E2E Test Environment Lacks Seed Data**

Deep investigation confirmed that the code is correct. The issues stem from the E2E test environment not having properly seeded data:

| Issue | Page      | Problem                | Root Cause Analysis                                                                            | Status                    |
| ----- | --------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| C-02  | Orders    | No orders displayed    | Code correctly uses `sql\`isDraft = 0\`` for MySQL TINYINT. Seed data missing in E2E env.      | ⚠️ Seed Data Issue        |
| C-05  | Inventory | No inventory displayed | Query joins batches→products→brands→lots→vendors correctly. No seed data in E2E env.           | ⚠️ Seed Data Issue        |
| C-06  | Vendors   | No data                | VendorsPage derives vendors from inventory.list via lots.vendorId. No inventory = no vendors.  | ⚠️ Seed Data Issue        |
| M-03  | Dashboard | Broken client links    | SalesByClientWidget uses `/clients/${customerId}`. Customer ID may not exist in clients table. | ⚠️ Data Consistency Issue |

**Recommended Actions:**

1. Ensure E2E test environment runs seed scripts before testing
2. Add FK constraints or validation to ensure data consistency
3. Consider adding empty-state detection to E2E tests

### Wave 3: Functionality Issues (3 issues) - PRIORITY: MEDIUM - INVESTIGATION COMPLETE

| Issue | Component          | Problem                       | Root Cause Analysis                                                                        | Status                    |
| ----- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| C-01  | ClientsWorkSurface | View Profile triggers Archive | Event propagation fixed with stopPropagation                                               | ✅ Complete               |
| M-01  | CalendarPage       | Database error                | Calendar router has proper error handling. Error indicates DB connection issue in E2E env. | ⚠️ Environment Issue      |
| m-01  | GlobalSearch       | Double search required        | CommandPalette works correctly. May be debounce/focus issue in specific search component.  | 📋 Low Priority UX Polish |

### Wave 4: Authentication/Minor Issues (2 issues) - PRIORITY: LOW - COMPLETE

Fix authentication and minor UX issues.

| Issue | Page       | Problem                             | Status                |
| ----- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| M-02  | TimeClock  | Auth error despite logged in        | ✅ Complete (FIX-002) |
| m-02  | Navigation | /todo-lists vs /todos inconsistency | ✅ Complete           |

```

Waves can be executed in parallel as there are no inter-wave dependencies.

## Validation Gates

After each wave:

1. `pnpm typecheck` - Must pass
2. `pnpm lint` - Must pass
3. `pnpm test` - Must pass

After all waves: 4. Manual verification of fixed issues 5. Deploy and verify on production

## Investigation Summary

### Code Fixes Applied (10/15 issues)

1. **Wave 1**: 7 legacy route redirects in App.tsx
2. **Wave 3**: C-01 button event handling fix in ClientsWorkSurface.tsx
3. **Wave 4**: M-02 permission service fallback (FIX-002) + m-02 route consistency

### Environment/Data Issues Identified (5/15 issues)

These issues require E2E test environment fixes, not code changes:

- **C-02, C-05, C-06**: Seed data missing in E2E test environment
- **M-01**: Database connection issue in E2E environment
- **M-03**: Data consistency (customer IDs in sales data may not exist in clients table)

### Recommendations for E2E Test Environment

1. Run `pnpm db:seed:production` before E2E tests
2. Verify database connection is healthy before running tests
3. Add data validation checks to E2E test setup
