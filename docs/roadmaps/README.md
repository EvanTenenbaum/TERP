## How to Use This System

### For Development Agents

**Before Starting Work:**

1. Read this README to see the active roadmap
2. Open the active roadmap file
3. Check `../notes/user-feedback.md` for latest feedback (if exists)
4. Review `../HANDOFF_CONTEXT.md` for what the last agent did (if exists)
5. Review `../DEVELOPMENT_PROTOCOLS.md` for development standards

**During Work:**

1. Update the roadmap file as you complete phases
2. Check off completed tasks using `- [x]` syntax
3. Update status and progress notes
4. Commit changes regularly with descriptive messages

**Before Finishing:**

1. Update the roadmap with current status
2. Update `../HANDOFF_CONTEXT.md` with what you did and what's next (if exists)
3. Update `../CHANGELOG.md` with completed work
4. Commit and push all changes

### For Project Owner

**Adding New Roadmaps:**

1. Create a new markdown file in this directory
2. Add entry to this README with status and summary
3. Update "Active Roadmap" section if it's the new focus

**Providing Feedback:**

1. Add thoughts to `../notes/user-feedback.md`
2. Agents check this file at start of every session
3. Organize by date with clear headings
