### 2. Realistic Mock Data Generation
**Status:** 🔵 Planned  
**Priority:** High  
**Files:**
- [Implementation Roadmap](./realistic-mock-data-generation.md) - Complete implementation plan

**Summary:**  
Build a comprehensive mock data generation system that creates hyper-realistic business data for TERP with specific business parameters: 1 year of data, $2M/month revenue, 60 clients with whale distribution, consignment tracking, returns/refunds, and realistic AR aging.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Realistic data generation system for all 74 tables
- CLI commands for easy instance management
- Business parameter configuration ($24M annual revenue)
- Client distribution (10 whales = 70% of revenue)
- Consignment tracking (50% sales, 90% intake)
- Returns (0.5%) and refunds (5% of orders get 5% refund)
- AR aging (15% overdue, 50% of overdue is 120+ days)

**Business Parameters:**
- 1 year of transaction history (2024)
- $2M average monthly revenue
- 90% flower sales (indoor at $1800/lb)
- 60 clients (10 whales, 50 regular)
- Long-tail distribution (whales = 70% of purchases)
- No email addresses or physical addresses for clients
- Realistic consignment, returns, and AR aging

## How to Use This System

### For Development Agents

**Before Starting Work:**
1. Read this README to see the active roadmap
2. Open the active roadmap file
3. Check `../notes/user-feedback.md` for latest feedback (if exists)
4. Review `../HANDOFF_CONTEXT.md` for what the last agent did (if exists)
5. Review `../DEVELOPMENT_PROTOCOLS.md` for development standards

**During Work:**
1. Update the roadmap file as you complete phases
2. Check off completed tasks using `- [x]` syntax
3. Update status and progress notes
4. Commit changes regularly with descriptive messages

**Before Finishing:**
1. Update the roadmap with current status
2. Update `../HANDOFF_CONTEXT.md` with what you did and what's next (if exists)
3. Update `../CHANGELOG.md` with completed work
4. Commit and push all changes

---

### For Project Owner

**Adding New Roadmaps:**
1. Create a new markdown file in this directory
2. Add entry to this README with status and summary
3. Update "Active Roadmap" section if it's the new focus

**Providing Feedback:**
1. Add thoughts to `../notes/user-feedback.md`
2. Agents check this file at start of every session
3. Organize by date with clear headings

**Switching Active Roadmap:**
1. Update "Active Roadmap" section in this README
2. Inform the next agent which roadmap to work on

## Roadmap Lifecycle

1. **Created** → Roadmap written and saved
2. **Planned** → Added to index, status set to 🔵
3. **Ready** → Dependencies met, status set to 🟠
4. **Activated** → Set as active roadmap, status set to 🟡
5. **In Progress** → Development agent working on it
6. **Complete** → All phases done, status set to 🟢
7. **Archived** → Moved to archive/ subdirectory (optional)
