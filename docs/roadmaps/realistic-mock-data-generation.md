# Realistic Mock Data Generation Roadmap

**Status:** ðŸ”µ Planned  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days  
**Created:** October 27, 2025

---

## Overview

Build a comprehensive mock data generation system that creates hyper-realistic business data for TERP, enabling realistic testing and iteration without production data.

### Business Parameters

**Revenue & Scale:**
- 1 year of historical data
- $2M average monthly revenue ($24M annual)
- 90% flower sales, 10% other products
- Peak pricing: Indoor flower at $1,800/lb

**Client Distribution:**
- 60 total clients
- Long-tail distribution: 10 whales = 70% of purchases
- Remaining 50 clients = 30% of purchases
- No addresses or emails (B2B focus)

**Consignment Model:**
- 50% of sales on consignment
- 90% of intake on consignment
- Track consignment inventory separately

**Returns & Refunds:**
- 0.5% return rate
- 5% of orders get 5% refund (quality adjustments)

**Accounts Receivable:**
- 15% of debt overdue
- 50% of overdue debt is 120+ days old
- Realistic aging buckets (0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 91-120, 120+)

---

## Why This Matters

**Current Problem:**
- Limited seed data (only accounting module)
- Can't test realistic scenarios
- Hard to iterate on UI/UX with fake data
- No way to test edge cases (overdue payments, returns, consignment)

**Solution:**
- Hyper-realistic data that looks like real business
- Easy to spin up instances with/without data
- Reproducible for testing
- Covers all 74 database tables

---

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture (4 hours)

**Tasks:**
1. Install dependencies
   - `@faker-js/faker` - Realistic fake data
   - `date-fns` - Date manipulation
   - `seedrandom` - Reproducible randomness

2. Create directory structure
   ```
   scripts/seed/
   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts              # Main orchestrator
   â”œâ”€â”€ config.ts             # Business parameters
   â”œâ”€â”€ generators/           # Data generators
   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/                # Shared utilities
   â””â”€â”€ profiles/             # Data profiles
   ```

3. Define business parameter config
   ```typescript
   export const businessParams = {
     timeframe: {
       startDate: '2024-01-01',
       endDate: '2024-12-31',
       totalMonths: 12,
     },
     revenue: {
       monthlyAverage: 2_000_000,
       annualTotal: 24_000_000,
       flowerPercentage: 0.90,
     },
     clients: {
       total: 60,
       whales: 10,
       whaleRevenueShare: 0.70,
     },
     consignment: {
       salesPercentage: 0.50,
       intakePercentage: 0.90,
     },
     pricing: {
       indoorFlowerMaxPrice: 1800, // per pound
       pricePerGram: 1800 / 453.592, // ~$3.97/g
     },
     quality: {
       returnRate: 0.005,
       refundRate: 0.05,
       refundPercentage: 0.05,
     },
     ar: {
       overduePercentage: 0.15,
       overdue120DaysPercentage: 0.50,
     },
   };
   ```

4. Create base generator interface
   ```typescript
   interface DataGenerator<T> {
     generate(count: number, context: GenerationContext): Promise<T[]>;
     validate(data: T[]): boolean;
     getDependencies(): string[];
   }
   ```

**Deliverables:**
- âœ… Dependencies installed
- âœ… Directory structure created
- âœ… Business parameters configured
- âœ… Base interfaces defined

**Testing:**
- [ ] Run `pnpm install` successfully

### Phase 2: Client Distribution Generator (4 hours)

**Tasks:**
1. Create realistic client distribution
   - 10 whale clients (70% of revenue)
   - 50 long-tail clients (30% of revenue)
   - Assign monthly purchase patterns

2. Generate client data
   ```typescript
   {
     name: "Green Valley Distribution",  // Faker.company.name()
     contactName: "Sarah Martinez",      // Faker.person.fullName()
     phone: "(555) 123-4567",           // Faker.phone.number()
     // NO email, NO address (per requirements)
     creditLimit: 100000,                // Tiered for whales
     paymentTerms: "Net 30",
     status: "active",
     clientType: "whale" | "regular",
     monthlyPurchaseTarget: 140000,      // For whales
   }
   ```

3. Calculate client revenue targets
   - Whales: $24M Ã— 0.70 Ã· 10 = $1.68M/year each ($140k/month)
   - Regular: $24M Ã— 0.30 Ã· 50 = $144k/year each ($12k/month)
   - Add Â±20% variance for realism

4. Assign client purchase patterns
   - Whales: 2-4 orders/week
   - Regular: 1-2 orders/month
   - Seasonal variation (Q4 spike)

**Deliverables:**
- âœ… ClientGenerator with whale/regular distribution
- âœ… Realistic purchase patterns
- âœ… Credit limits and payment terms
- âœ… 60 clients seeded

**Testing:**
- [ ] Sum of client revenue targets = $24M Â±5%

     grade: "AAA",
     type: "flower",
     growType: "indoor",
     unitSize: "1lb",
     unitSizeGrams: 453.592,
     pricePerUnit: 1800,  // $1800/lb for indoor
     pricePerGram: 3.97,
     costPerUnit: 1200,   // 33% margin
   }
   ```

3. Create pricing tiers
   - Indoor: $1,800/lb (premium)
   - Greenhouse: $1,200/lb (mid-tier)
   - Outdoor: $800/lb (budget)
   - 90% of products are flower

4. Generate batches with consignment tracking
   ```typescript
   {
     batchNumber: "20240115-BLUEDREAM-001",
     productId: 1,
     quantity: 100,  // pounds
     costPerUnit: 1200,
     isConsignment: true,  // 90% of intake

   function generateOrders(clients: Client[], products: Product[]) {
     const orders = [];
     
     for (const client of clients) {
       const monthlyTarget = client.monthlyPurchaseTarget;
       const ordersPerMonth = client.clientType === 'whale' ? 12 : 2;
       
       for (let month = 0; month < 12; month++) {
         for (let i = 0; i < ordersPerMonth; i++) {
           const order = {
             clientId: client.id,
             orderDate: generateRandomDateInMonth(month),
             items: generateOrderItems(products, monthlyTarget / ordersPerMonth),
             isConsignment: Math.random() < 0.50,  // 50% consignment
             status: 'completed',
           };
           orders.push(order);
         }
       }
     }
     
     return orders;
   }
   ```

3. Generate order items with realistic quantities
   - Whales: 20-100 lbs per order

   - Mix of products (prefer indoor for whales)

4. Calculate COGS for each order
   - Use FIFO method
   - Track consignment vs. owned inventory
   - Calculate margins

5. Apply returns and refunds

     tax: 0,  // Cannabis tax handled separately
     total: 50000,
     status: "unpaid" | "paid" | "overdue",
   }
   ```

2. Generate payment records
   - 85% of invoices paid on time or early
   - 15% overdue
   - Of overdue: 50% are 120+ days old

3. Create aging buckets
   ```typescript
   function calculateAgingBuckets(invoices: Invoice[]) {
     const aging = {
       current: 0,      // 0-30 days
       days31_60: 0,
       days61_90: 0,
       days91_120: 0,
       days120plus: 0,
     };
     
     for (const invoice of invoices) {
       const daysOverdue = daysSince(invoice.dueDate);
       if (daysOverdue <= 30) aging.current += invoice.total;
       else if (daysOverdue <= 60) aging.days31_60 += invoice.total;
       else if (daysOverdue <= 90) aging.days61_90 += invoice.total;
       else if (daysOverdue <= 120) aging.days91_120 += invoice.total;
       else aging.days120plus += invoice.total;
     }
     
     return aging;
   }
   ```

4. Generate payment history

- âœ… 15% of debt overdue
- âœ… 50% of overdue debt 120+ days old

---

## Notes

- **No email addresses or physical addresses** for clients (B2B focus)
- **Consignment tracking** is critical - separate inventory pools
- **Whale clients** should have realistic names (not "Client 1")
- **Returns vs Refunds:** Returns are full, refunds are partial (5%)
- **AR aging** must match real-world patterns (some clients always late)
- **Seasonal variation:** Q4 should be 20-30% higher than Q1-Q3
- **Product mix:** 90% flower, but include some pre-rolls, edibles, etc.
- **Pricing tiers:** Indoor > Greenhouse > Outdoor (realistic market)

---

## Future Enhancements

- Multiple data profiles (small/medium/large)
- Custom parameter overrides via CLI
- Export data to CSV for analysis
- Data anonymization for demos
- Synthetic data generation (ML-based)
