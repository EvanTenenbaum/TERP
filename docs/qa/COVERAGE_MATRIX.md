## Revision Notes

> **IMPORTANT**: This matrix has been revised following a third-party expert review and product decisions.
>
> **Key Corrections**:
> - ~~P0-002 (Inventory oversell race condition)~~ - FALSE POSITIVE removed
> - ~~P0-004 (Individual feature flags)~~ - CLOSED (deployment flags sufficient per product)
> - InventoryWorkSurface risk upgraded (locking IS implemented)
> - P0-002 (NEW): Flexible lot selection needed (not strict FIFO/LIFO)
> - P0-003: RETURNED status with restock/vendor-return paths
> - P1-001: Current void logic correct; add void reason field

### Feature Flags

| Work Surface | Deployment Flag | Fallback | Gating |
|--------------|----------------|----------|--------|
| OrdersWorkSurface | ✅ WORK_SURFACE_ORDERS | ✅ Legacy page | ✅ |
| InvoicesWorkSurface | ✅ WORK_SURFACE_ACCOUNTING | ✅ Legacy page | ✅ |
| InventoryWorkSurface | ✅ WORK_SURFACE_INVENTORY | ✅ Legacy page | ✅ |
| ClientsWorkSurface | ✅ WORK_SURFACE_ORDERS | ✅ Legacy page | ✅ |
| PurchaseOrdersWorkSurface | ✅ WORK_SURFACE_INTAKE | ✅ Legacy page | ✅ |
| PickPackWorkSurface | ✅ WORK_SURFACE_INVENTORY | ✅ Legacy page | ✅ |
| ClientLedgerWorkSurface | ✅ WORK_SURFACE_ACCOUNTING | ✅ Legacy page | ✅ |
| QuotesWorkSurface | ✅ WORK_SURFACE_ORDERS | ✅ Legacy page | ✅ |
| DirectIntakeWorkSurface | ✅ WORK_SURFACE_INTAKE | ✅ Legacy page | ✅ |

**Status**: ✅ All deployment flags working. Product decision: individual surface flags not needed.

### Golden Flows

| Flow | Steps | Implemented | Blocked Steps | Status |
|------|-------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Intake → Inventory | 10 | 10 | 0 | ✅ Complete |
| Client → Order → Invoice | 8 | 8 | 0 | ✅ Complete |
| Invoice → Payment → Reconciliation | 7 | 3 | 4 | ❌ Broken |

**Critical Issue**: Payment recording stub (P0-001)

---

### Adversarial Testing

| Scenario | OrdersWS | InvoicesWS | InventoryWS | ClientsWS | Others |
|----------|----------|------------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Concurrent Edit Detection | ⚠️ Optional | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Rapid State Transitions | ❌ No debounce | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Privilege Escalation | ✅ Protected | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Data Integrity | ✅ Locked | ✅ | ⚠️ No FIFO | ✅ | ✅ |
| Input Validation | ⚠️ No max len | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |

**Critical Issues**: 1 (rapid transitions - no debounce on OrdersWS confirm button)

> **Note**: Original report claimed "inventory oversell race condition" but code review confirms `ordersDb.ts:290-296` properly implements `.for("update")` row-level locking.

### Unit Test Coverage

| Work Surface | Hook Tests | Component Tests | E2E Tests | Total Coverage |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
| OrdersWorkSurface | ✅ Shared | ❌ None | ✅ | Partial |

| ClientLedgerWorkSurface | ✅ Shared | ❌ None | ❌ | Low |
| QuotesWorkSurface | ✅ Shared | ❌ None | ✅ | Partial |
| DirectIntakeWorkSurface | ✅ Shared | ❌ None | ❌ | Low |

**Hook Tests**: 6 files (excellent quality)
**Component Tests**: 0 of 9 (critical gap)

## Risk Assessment

| Work Surface | Overall Risk | Key Issues |
|--------------|--------------|------------|
| OrdersWorkSurface | 🔴 HIGH | Missing RETURNED status, no debounce on confirm |
| InvoicesWorkSurface | 🔴 HIGH | Payment stub (P0-001), need void reason field, error display missing |
| InventoryWorkSurface | 🟡 MEDIUM | Flexible lot selection needed (concurrency IS protected via row locks) |
| ClientsWorkSurface | 🟢 LOW | Type safety only |
| PurchaseOrdersWorkSurface | 🟢 LOW | Missing E2E tests only |
| PickPackWorkSurface | 🟡 MEDIUM | Refetch race condition |
| ClientLedgerWorkSurface | 🟡 MEDIUM | Depends on payment flow being fixed |
| QuotesWorkSurface | 🟢 LOW | No significant issues |
| DirectIntakeWorkSurface | 🟡 MEDIUM | Deprecated endpoint (vendors.getAll), type safety |

> **Revision Note**: InventoryWorkSurface risk stayed MEDIUM - row-level locking confirmed, but lot selection still needed.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix P0 Blockers** (3 issues) - Before production
2. **Fix P1 Critical** (8 issues) - Includes test coverage issue P1-008
3. **Add Component Tests** (9 files) - Critical gap identified
4. **Fix P2 Important** (9 issues) - Includes new E2E/flow coverage issues

> **Updated Counts**: After product decisions: 3 P0, 8 P1, 9 P2, 4 P3 = **24 total**
