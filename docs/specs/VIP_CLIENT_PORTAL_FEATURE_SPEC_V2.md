## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the feature specification for the TERP VIP Client Portal, a premium, client-facing web application. The portal is designed to empower high-value clients with immediate, actionable insights into their account, a direct line to the marketplace, and a clear understanding of their financial relationship with TERP.

### 1.1. Goals and Objectives

The primary goals of the VIP Client Portal are to:

*   **Enable Self-Service:** Allow clients to answer their own financial questions in under 30 seconds, eliminating the need for back-and-forth communication with account managers.
*   **Streamline Marketplace Interaction:** Create the fastest, most efficient channel for clients to communicate their needs and supply to the TERP ecosystem.
*   **Foster Proactive Relationships:** Transform the client relationship from reactive (answering questions) to proactive (providing insights and opportunities).
*   **Drive Growth:** Incentivize desired client behaviors through a rewarding VIP Tier system.

### 1.2. Scope

This specification covers the design and functionality of the client-facing portal. It includes:

*   User Authentication (with Team Permissions and SSO)
*   Action-Oriented Dashboard
*   Financial Hub (Transaction History, AR/AP, and Direct Payments)
*   VIP Tier System
*   Interactive Credit Center
*   Streamlined Marketplace (separate flows for Needs and Supply)

## 2. Authentication and Team Management

The portal will feature a robust and flexible authentication system that supports both individual users and client teams.

### 2.1. Authentication Methods

*   **Password Login:** Standard email and password authentication.
*   **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Integration with Google and Microsoft for one-click login.

### 2.2. Team Permissions

A primary client user (the "Admin") can invite and manage team members with the following roles:

| Role                | Permissions                                                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Admin**           | Full access to all portal features, including team management.                |
| **Finance**         | Access to the Financial Hub and Credit Center. Can view and pay invoices.   |
| **Marketplace Manager** | Access to the Marketplace to create and manage needs and supply listings.     |
| **Viewer**          | Read-only access to all sections of the portal.                             |

## 3. Action-Oriented Dashboard

The dashboard will be a personalized and dynamic landing page that guides the user's attention to the most important information and tasks.

*   **Personalized Greeting:** A simple "Good morning, [Client Name]" to create a more welcoming experience.
*   **Action Center:** A prominent section at the top of the page that highlights urgent tasks, such as:
    *   "You have 2 overdue invoices totaling $5,000."
    *   "Your credit limit is 90% utilized. Consider making a payment to free up credit."
    *   "You have 3 needs listings that are expiring in the next 24 hours."
*   **Contextual KPIs:** Key metrics with trend indicators:
    *   **Current Balance:** $10,000 (up 15% from last month)
    *   **YTD Spend:** $150,000 (on track to reach the Platinum tier)
*   **Quick Access:** One-click access to the most frequently used features.

## 4. Financial Hub

The Financial Hub is a unified section for all financial information, designed for clarity and action.

### 4.1. Interactive Charts

*   **Spending Trends:** A visual breakdown of spending by month, quarter, or year.
*   **AR/AP Aging:** A chart showing the age of outstanding invoices and bills.

### 4.2. Smart Search & Direct Payments

*   **Natural Language Search:** A search bar that allows users to find transactions with simple queries (e.g., "show me all invoices from last quarter").
*   **Direct Payments:** A "Pay Now" button next to each outstanding invoice, allowing clients to pay directly through the portal via credit card or ACH.

## 5. VIP Tier System

The VIP Tier System replaces the generic leaderboard with a more exclusive and rewarding program.

### 5.1. Tiers and Rewards

Clients will be placed into one of three tiers based on their transaction volume, payment history, and engagement.

| Tier      | Requirements                               | Rewards                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Platinum** | Top 5% of clients                          | Priority support, early access, best terms    |
| **Gold**    | Top 20% of clients                         | Expedited support, exclusive offers           |
| **Silver**  | All other VIP clients                      | Standard VIP benefits                         |

### 5.2. Data-Driven Recommendations

The portal will provide specific, actionable advice on how to move up to the next tier. For example: "You are $5,000 in transaction volume away from reaching the Platinum tier."

## 6. Interactive Credit Center

The Credit Center will be an interactive and educational tool to help clients understand and manage their credit.

### 6.1. Interactive Credit Calculator

A simple calculator will allow clients to see how certain actions would impact their credit limit. For example, they could input a payment amount and see the resulting increase in their available credit.

### 6.2. Specific, Data-Driven Advice

Instead of generic suggestions, the portal will provide concrete recommendations based on the client's data. For example: "You have 2 invoices that are more than 30 days overdue. Paying these will have a significant positive impact on your credit limit."

## 7. Streamlined Marketplace

The Marketplace will feature separate, tailored user flows for buying and selling to reduce confusion and user error.

### 7.1. Separate User Flows

*   **"I Need to Buy":** A dedicated form for submitting needs, with language and fields optimized for the buying process.
*   **"I Have to Sell":** A separate form for submitting supply, with language and fields tailored to the selling process.

### 7.2. Intelligent Defaults and Templates

*   **Intelligent Defaults:** The system will use the client's past activity to pre-fill form fields and suggest common needs or supplies.
*   **Saved Templates:** Clients can save their frequent needs or supplies as templates for one-click posting in the future.

This revised specification provides a blueprint for a truly exceptional VIP Client Portal that will drive engagement, strengthen client relationships, and provide a significant competitive advantage.
