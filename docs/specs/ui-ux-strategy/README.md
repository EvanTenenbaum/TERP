# TERP UI/UX Strategy Package (v2)

This package contains an agent-ingestible, strategy-first UX doctrine and master UI/UX strategy for TERP.

## Contents

- `docs/TERP_Master_UI_UX_Strategy.md`  
  The primary strategy document: synthesis + decisions + patterns + specs (Intake/PO as primary exemplar) + technical guidance.

- `docs/TERP_UX_DOCTRINE.md`  
  The reusable UX doctrine to apply across modules (Velocity / Safety / Context) and the Work Surface interaction contract.

- `docs/FEATURE_PRESERVATION_SYSTEM.md`  
  A loss-proof process to prevent critical features and product intent from being dropped during refactors.

- `docs/UX_PATTERN_REGISTRY.md`  
  The canonical registry of allowed UI patterns (and anti-patterns) that agents must follow.

- `assets/`  
  Reference images used in discussions and mockups.

## How agents should use this

1. Read `TERP_UX_DOCTRINE.md` (contracts and non-negotiables).
2. Read `UX_PATTERN_REGISTRY.md` (allowed patterns + when to use them).
3. Read `FEATURE_PRESERVATION_SYSTEM.md` (how to avoid losing product scope).
4. Execute changes guided by `TERP_Master_UI_UX_Strategy.md`.
