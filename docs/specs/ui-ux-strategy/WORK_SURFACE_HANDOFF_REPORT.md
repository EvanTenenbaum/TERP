## 1. Product Overview

### What is TERP?

TERP is an **enterprise resource planning (ERP) system** built for cannabis/wholesale distribution operations. It manages:

- **Inventory**: Product intake, batch tracking, multi-location storage, transfers
- **Sales**: Orders, quotes, live shopping, client management, samples
- **Procurement**: Purchase orders, supplier management, intake
- **Accounting**: Invoices, payments, AR/AP, general ledger, fiscal periods
- **Fulfillment**: Pick & pack, shipping, returns
- **CRM**: Client profiles, needs matching, VIP portal

### Business Context

TERP users perform **high-velocity, repetitive data entry** operations:

- Intake specialists enter 50-100 product lines per session
- Sales reps create multiple orders per day
- Warehouse staff pick/pack dozens of orders continuously

Current pain point: **Modal-heavy workflows** slow down these operations with excessive clicks and context switches.

### Current Tech Stack

| Layer         | Technology                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend      | React 18 + TypeScript + Vite                |
| UI Components | shadcn/ui (Radix primitives) + Tailwind CSS |
| Data Grid     | AG Grid Community                           |
| State/Data    | tRPC + React Query                          |
| Routing       | Wouter (lightweight router)                 |
| Backend       | Express + tRPC + Drizzle ORM                |
| Database      | MySQL                                       |
| Notifications | Sonner (toast library)                      |

### Codebase Stats

- **86 pages** in `/client/src/pages/`
- **125 tRPC routers** in `/server/src/routers/`
- **258KB database schema** with soft deletes (`deletedAt`) and optimistic locking (`version` field)

## 2. UX Redesign Goal

### Problem Statement

> TERP's current UX slows high-velocity operations by overusing modal flows, context switches, and non-deterministic focus behavior. Users want "really simple data entry" and "spreadsheet-like speed" **without** turning TERP into a fragile, unconstrained spreadsheet.

### Success Metrics

| Metric              | Target                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Time-to-entry       | Reduce median time from opening workflow to committing a valid row |
| Keystroke count     | Reduce average keystrokes + pointer interactions per row/record    |
| Error recovery time | Reduce time from validation failure to corrected commit            |
| Context switching   | Minimize view/surface changes per workflow completion              |

### Non-Goals

- We are NOT building a general-purpose spreadsheet
- We are NOT removing validation and constraints
- We are NOT changing the underlying data model or schema

---

## 3. Core Design Principles

### UX Doctrine (Non-Negotiable)

These rules must never be violated:

| Priority | Principle                       | Meaning                                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | **Velocity → Safety → Context** | Always optimize for speed first, then correctness, then information |
| 2        | **Keyboard-first contracts**    | Tab/Enter/Esc must work consistently across all Work Surfaces       |
| 3        | **Deterministic focus**         | No unexpected focus jumps; user always knows where they are         |
| 4        | **No core-flow modals**         | High-frequency operations never use blocking modals                 |
| 5        | **Hybrid editing**              | Inline for primitives, inspector for complex objects                |
| 6        | **Save state always visible**   | User always sees: Saved / Saving / Needs attention                  |

### Explicit Violations (Never Do This)

- Nested modals in core flows
- Field-level selection inside Cmd+K command palette
- Complex multi-field objects edited in grid cells
- Modal-only workflows for high-frequency operations
- Unbounded customization that breaks consistency

---

## 4. The Work Surface Pattern

### What is a Work Surface?

A **Work Surface** is the universal execution shell for high-frequency workflows. It replaces modal-heavy patterns with a consistent, keyboard-driven interface.

### Anatomy

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CONTEXT HEADER (sticky)                            h: 64-80px   │
│ [Supplier: Acme Corp ▼] [Location: Warehouse A ▼] [Date: Today]   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┬───────────┤
│                                                     │           │
│                                                     │  INSPECTOR│
│                    PRIMARY GRID                     │  PANEL    │
│                                                     │           │
│  Product     | Qty | Unit | Cost   | Total          │  Details  │

│  Strain B    | 5   | oz   | $25.00 | $125.00        │  Actions  │
│  [+ Add row] |     |      |        |                │           │
│                                                     │  w: 360-  │
│                                                     │  400px    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴───────────┤
│ STATUS BAR: 2 items | $625.00 total | ✅ Saved      h: 48px     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Components

| Component           | Purpose                                         | Behavior                                        |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Context Header**  | Batch-level defaults (supplier, location, date) | Sticky; applies to all new rows                 |
| **Primary Grid**    | Fast row entry with inline editing              | Keyboard-navigable; virtualized for performance |
| **Inspector Panel** | Complex edits and audit context                 | Non-modal; Esc closes; never blocks grid        |
| **Status Bar**      | Save state, totals, error summary               | Sticky bottom; always visible                   |

### When to Use Work Surface vs Other Patterns

| Condition                       | Use                         |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| >5 similar actions per session  | Work Surface                |
| Editing rows in sequence        | Work Surface + Primary Grid |
| Single record edited rarely     | Form                        |
| Read-only analysis/reporting    | Review Surface              |
| Complex fields with audit needs | Inspector Panel             |

### Review Surface (Read-Only Variant)

For dashboards, reports, and analysis views:

| Aspect         | Work Surface      | Review Surface    |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Primary action | Create/Edit       | Filter/Export     |
| Grid behavior  | Inline edit       | Click to navigate |
| Inspector      | Edit form         | Read-only details |
| Context header | Editable defaults | Filter controls   |
| Background     | `bg-background`   | `bg-muted/30`     |

---

## 5. Technical Architecture

### Keyboard Contract (Global)

Every Work Surface must implement this exactly:

| Key            | Action                                                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tab**        | Move to next field/cell                                             |
| **Shift+Tab**  | Move to previous field/cell                                         |
| **Enter**      | Commit edit; if row valid, create next row                          |
| **Esc**        | Cancel edit or close inspector                                      |
| **Cmd/Ctrl+Z** | Undo last destructive action                                        |
| **Cmd+K**      | Open command palette (navigation/actions ONLY, not field selection) |

### Validation Timing ("Reward Early, Punish Late")

```
User types → No errors shown (success indicators OK)
User blurs field → Validation runs, errors appear
User commits row → Final validation, errors block commit
```

- **Never** show required-field errors while typing
- **Always** validate on blur and commit
- **Server validates everything** regardless of client validation

### Save State Indicator

Only three states allowed:

| State              | Visual          | Meaning                      |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ✅ Saved           | Green checkmark | Persisted to server          |
| 🟡 Saving...       | Yellow spinner  | Request in flight            |
| 🔴 Needs attention | Red warning     | Validation error or conflict |

### Responsive Breakpoints

| Breakpoint  | Grid        | Inspector         | Mobile Priority Modules                          |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ≥1440px     | Full        | 400px fixed right | —                                                |
| 1280-1439px | Full        | 360px fixed right | —                                                |
| 1024-1279px | Full        | Slide-over sheet  | —                                                |
| 768-1023px  | Reduced     | Full-screen sheet | —                                                |
| <768px      | Card layout | Full-screen       | **Inventory, Accounting, Todo/Tasks, Dashboard** |

### Grid Specifications

| Property            | Value                       |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Row height          | 40px (touch-friendly)       |
| Cell padding        | 8px horizontal              |
| Min column width    | 80px                        |
| Max column width    | 400px                       |
| Header row height   | 44px                        |
| Max visible columns | 8-10 (no horizontal scroll) |

### Animation Tokens

| Animation         | Duration               | Easing      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| Inspector open    | 200ms                  | ease-out    |
| Inspector close   | 150ms                  | ease-in     |
| Row creation      | 150ms                  | ease-out    |
| Row deletion      | 150ms + 100ms collapse | ease-in     |
| Save state change | 300ms                  | ease-in-out |

When `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`: All animations become instant (0ms).

| CRM         | 6        | 0        | Partial               |

### Golden Flows (Must Never Break)

| Flow                         | Entry                | Key Steps                                            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **GF-001 Direct Intake**     | /spreadsheet         | Create session → Add items → Set supplier → Finalize |
| **GF-002 Standard PO**       | /purchase-orders     | Create PO → Submit → Receive goods                   |
| **GF-003 Sales Order**       | /orders              | Select client → Add items → Finalize                 |
| **GF-004 Invoice & Payment** | /accounting/invoices | Generate → Send → Receive payment                    |
| **GF-005 Pick & Pack**       | /pick-pack           | View → Pick → Pack → Ship                            |

| **GF-008 Sample Request**    | /samples             | Create → Approve → Fulfill                           |

**Golden flow enforcement notes:**

- Each golden flow must be mapped to its Feature Preservation Matrix P0/P1 entries.
- Each golden flow must be validated under at least one RBAC role that owns the flow.

### RBAC Validation Matrix (Per Golden Flow)

> **Critical**: Each golden flow must be tested with the appropriate RBAC role.

| Flow   | Required Permissions                 | Owning Roles             | Test Using                |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| GF-001 | `inventory:write`, `batches:create`  | Inventory, Super Admin   | QA Auth: Inventory role   |
| GF-002 | `purchase_orders:write`              | Inventory, Purchasing    | QA Auth: Inventory role   |
| GF-003 | `orders:write`, `inventory:read`     | Sales Rep, Sales Manager | QA Auth: Sales Manager    |
| GF-004 | `invoices:write`, `payments:write`   | Accounting               | QA Auth: Accounting role  |
| GF-005 | `pick_pack:write`, `inventory:write` | Fulfillment              | QA Auth: Fulfillment role |
| GF-006 | `clients:read`, `ledger:read`        | Sales Rep, Accounting    | QA Auth: Sales Rep        |
| GF-007 | `inventory:write`                    | Inventory                | QA Auth: Inventory role   |
| GF-008 | `samples:write`                      | Sales Rep, Sales Manager | QA Auth: Sales Manager    |

> **Note**: Use the QA Auth system (AUTH-QA-001) with `/api/qa-auth/login` for deterministic RBAC testing.

### API-Only Features (No UI Needed)

These features intentionally have no UI:

| Feature                     | Rationale                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| DF-030 Crypto Payments      | Backend payment processor integration |
| DF-031 Installment Payments | Payment plan management via API       |
| DF-034 Transaction Fees     | Automated fee calculation             |
| DF-035 Invoice Disputes     | Dispute workflow via API              |
| DF-038 Catalog Publishing   | External integration API              |
| DF-046 System Monitoring    | Admin diagnostics tool                |
| DF-048 Supplier Reminders   | Automated notification system         |
| DF-057 Deployment Tracking  | DevOps tool                           |

## 7. Implementation Priorities

### P0 — Blockers (Before Any Work Surface Deployment)

| Task    | Description                    | Dependencies |
| ------- | ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| UXS-101 | Keyboard contract hook         | None         |
| UXS-102 | Save-state indicator component | None         |
| UXS-104 | Validation timing helper       | None         |
| UXS-703 | Loading skeleton components    | None         |
| UXS-704 | Error boundary wrapper         | None         |

### P1 — Production Readiness

| Task    | Description               | Dependencies |
| ------- | ------------------------- | ------------ |
| UXS-103 | Inspector panel shell     | UXS-101      |
| UXS-701 | Responsive breakpoints    | UXS-103      |
| UXS-705 | Concurrent edit detection | None         |
| UXS-801 | Accessibility audit       | UXS-101..104 |

**Dependency reminder:** Responsive breakpoints (UXS-701) require the inspector shell (UXS-103) to avoid modal regressions on tablet/mobile layouts.

### P2 — Scale

| Task    | Description            |
| ------- | ---------------------- |
| UXS-707 | Undo infrastructure    |
| UXS-802 | Performance monitoring |
| UXS-803 | Bulk operation limits  |
| UXS-901 | Empty state components |
| UXS-902 | Toast standardization  |
| UXS-903 | Print stylesheet       |
| UXS-904 | Export functionality   |

### BETA — Post-Launch

| Task    | Description             | Notes                              |
| ------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| UXS-702 | Offline queue + sync    | Deprioritized per product decision |
| UXS-706 | Session timeout handler | Depends on UXS-702                 |

## 8. Feature Flag Rollout Strategy

### Required Feature Flags

Each Work Surface module requires a dedicated feature flag for safe deployment:

| Flag Name                 | Default | Controls                           | Rollout Order |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `WORK_SURFACE_INTAKE`     | false   | UXS-201..203 (Intake/PO pilot)     | 1st           |
| `WORK_SURFACE_ORDERS`     | false   | UXS-301..302 (Sales/Orders)        | 2nd           |
| `WORK_SURFACE_INVENTORY`  | false   | UXS-401..402 (Inventory/Pick-Pack) | 3rd           |
| `WORK_SURFACE_ACCOUNTING` | false   | UXS-501..502 (Accounting/Ledger)   | 4th           |

### Rollout Phases

1. **Internal Testing** (flag: false for all users)
   - QA team tests with flag override
   - Use QA Auth for role-specific validation

2. **Pilot Users** (flag: enabled for specific users)
   - Enable via user override in feature flag system
   - Collect feedback for 1-2 weeks

3. **General Availability** (flag: true by default)
   - Monitor error rates and performance
   - Keep flag available for instant rollback

### Rollback Criteria

Rollback flag to `false` immediately if:

- Error rate increases >5% compared to baseline
- P95 response time degrades >50%
- User-reported critical workflow blocking
- Data integrity issues detected

### Implementation

```typescript
// Example usage in component
import { useFeatureFlag } from '@/hooks/useFeatureFlag';

const IntakePage = () => {
  const useWorkSurface = useFeatureFlag('WORK_SURFACE_INTAKE');

  if (useWorkSurface) {
    return <IntakeWorkSurface />;
  }
  return <IntakeLegacy />;
};
```

## 9. Product Decisions (Locked)

These decisions have been made and should not be revisited without explicit product approval:

### Locked Decisions

| Decision                    | Choice                                       | Rationale                                                   |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Offline Support**         | BETA priority (not P0/P1)                    | Not required for initial release                            |
| **Mobile Priority Modules** | Inventory, Accounting, Todo/Tasks, Dashboard | These workflows are used on mobile                          |
| **Other Modules Mobile**    | P2                                           | Desktop-first for other modules                             |
| **Cmd+K Scope**             | Actions/navigation only                      | Never use for field selection                               |
| **Direct Intake Schema**    | Compress UX, not schema                      | Auto-create PO + receipt + batch, but keep distinct records |
| **Complex Field Editing**   | Inspector panel only                         | Never inline for multi-field objects                        |
| **Validation Timing**       | Reward early, punish late                    | Errors on blur/commit only                                  |

### Firm Constraints

- **Do NOT** merge intake/PO schema events
- **Do NOT** add nested modals to core flows
- **Do NOT** route field selection through Cmd+K
- **Do NOT** make grids fully unconstrained like spreadsheets
- **Do NOT** hide save state from users

## 10. Open Questions

These require product input before implementation:

| #   | Question                                                                                        | Impact                       |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1   | **Conflict resolution**: Should conflicts auto-resolve (last-write-wins) or always prompt user? | Affects concurrent edit UX   |
| 2   | **Export limits**: Is 10,000 row limit acceptable?                                              | Affects large data exports   |
| 3   | **Bulk limits**: Is 500 selection / 100 update limit acceptable?                                | Affects power user workflows |
| 4   | **DF-067 Recurring Orders**: Should this missing feature be added to backlog?                   | Sales workflow expansion     |
| 5   | **API-only features**: Should any of the 8 API-only features get UI surfaces?                   | Scope expansion              |
| 6   | **VIP Portal scope**: Should VIP portal pages be redesigned with Work Surface patterns?         | VIP experience               |
| 7   | **Hidden routes**: Should any of the 11 hidden routes be surfaced in main navigation?           | Discoverability              |

## 11. Golden Rules

### For Any AI Agent Working on This Project

1. **Read ATOMIC_UX_STRATEGY.md first** — Contains the full doctrine and primitives
2. **Check FEATURE_PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md** — Ensure no feature is lost
3. **Follow PATTERN_APPLICATION_PLAYBOOK.md** — Decision rules for patterns
4. **Update documentation** — Any new pattern or exception must be documented

### Before Writing Any Code

- [ ] Identify which module you're modifying
- [ ] Check if Work Surface or Review Surface applies
- [ ] Confirm keyboard contract will be preserved
- [ ] Verify save-state indicator is visible
- [ ] Ensure validation timing follows "reward early, punish late"

### Before Submitting Any PR

- [ ] Work Surface shell used for high-frequency workflows
- [ ] Inline edits restricted to primitives
- [ ] Complex fields open in inspector
- [ ] Save-state indicator visible at all times
- [ ] Keyboard contract: Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Esc work as specified
- [ ] Loading states use skeletons matching layout
- [ ] Errors appear on blur/commit, not during typing
- [ ] Empty states have clear message + CTA
- [ ] Undo available for destructive actions
- [ ] Focus indicators visible (2px, ≥3:1 contrast)
- [ ] Feature Preservation Matrix updated or referenced
- [ ] Modal replacements documented when retiring modals
- [ ] Golden flows validated under RBAC roles that own the workflows
- [ ] Rollback path documented (feature flag or revert plan)

## Quick Reference Card

### Work Surface Components

```
Context Header → Batch defaults (supplier, location, date)
Primary Grid   → Fast row entry, keyboard-first
Inspector      → Complex edits, non-modal, Esc closes
Status Bar     → Save state, totals, errors
```

### Keyboard Map

```
Tab        → Next field
Shift+Tab  → Previous field
Enter      → Commit row, create next
Esc        → Cancel edit / close inspector
Cmd+K      → Command palette (nav/actions only)
Cmd+Z      → Undo
```

### Save States

```
✅ Saved           → Green, persisted
🟡 Saving...       → Yellow, in flight
🔴 Needs attention → Red, error/conflict
```

### Module → Pattern

```
Intake, Orders, Pick/Pack  → Work Surface + Grid
Dashboard, Reports         → Review Surface
Settings, Admin            → Forms
Client Profile             → Panel + Review
```
