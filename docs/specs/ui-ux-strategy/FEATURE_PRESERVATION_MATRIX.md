### Resolution Outcomes

Each unknown feature should be resolved to one of:

1. **confirmed** - UI exists and is documented; add to Work Surface migration plan
2. **api-only** - Intentionally backend-only; no UI required; document rationale
3. **missing** - Should have UI but doesn't; add to backlog with priority
4. **deprecated** - No longer needed; document deprecation

### Validation Process

1. **Search codebase**: Look for UI routes, components, or page references
2. **Check API router**: Confirm if backend functionality exists
3. **Interview stakeholders**: Confirm if feature is actively used
4. **Document decision**: Update this matrix with rationale
