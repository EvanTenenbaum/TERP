# Specification: WS-002 - Quick Action: Pay Vendor (Cash Out)

**Status:** Approved  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Estimate:** 12h  
**Module:** Accounting  
**Dependencies:** None (mirrors WS-001 flow)  
**Spec Author:** Manus AI

## 1. Problem Statement

Paying vendors in cash is a frequent operation that currently requires navigating through the full Journal Entry system. Users need a streamlined "opposite flow" to WS-001 that allows recording vendor cash payments in **3 clicks or less**, maintaining consistency with the Receive Payment quick action while handling the different accounting treatment (AP reduction vs AR reduction).

## 2. User Stories

1. **As a staff member**, I want to quickly record a cash payment to a vendor, so that I can process vendor payments efficiently without navigating complex forms.

2. **As a staff member**, I want to see the vendor's updated balance after payment, so that I can confirm how much we still owe.

3. **As a staff member**, I want to generate a payment confirmation/receipt, so that I have documentation for the vendor and our records.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Core Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| FR-01 | Quick Action button accessible from Accounting dashboard and Vendor Profile | Must Have |
| FR-02 | Simple 3-field form: Vendor, Amount, Payment Type (Cash/Check/Wire) | Must Have |
| FR-03 | Real-time vendor balance preview before saving | Must Have |
| FR-04 | Single "Save & Generate Confirmation" button to complete transaction | Must Have |
| FR-05 | Auto-populate vendor field when accessed from Vendor Profile | Should Have |
| FR-06 | Optional note/reference field (e.g., invoice number) | Should Have |
| FR-07 | Link payment to specific bills/invoices (optional allocation) | Nice to Have |

### 3.2 Business Rules

| ID | Rule | Example |
|----|------|---------|
| BR-01 | Payment amount must be positive and non-zero | Reject $0 or negative amounts |
| BR-02 | Payment reduces amount owed to vendor (AP) | $10K payment on $25K owed → $15K remaining |
| BR-03 | Overpayment creates prepayment/credit with vendor | $10K payment on $5K owed → -$5K (prepaid) |
| BR-04 | All payments must be logged with timestamp and user | Audit trail requirement |
| BR-05 | Payment type determines journal entry categorization | Cash → Cash account, Check → Bank account |
| BR-06 | Vendor payments debit AP, credit Cash/Bank | Opposite of client payment accounting |

## 4. Technical Specification

### 4.1 Data Model Changes

```sql
-- No new tables required
-- Uses existing tables:
-- - vendor_payments (for recording the payment)
-- - journal_entries (for double-entry accounting)
-- - vendors (for balance tracking)

-- Ensure vendor_payments table has:
-- - payment_type ENUM('CASH', 'CHECK', 'WIRE', 'ACH', 'OTHER')
-- - note TEXT (optional)
-- - reference_number VARCHAR(100) (for invoice/PO reference)
-- - confirmation_generated_at TIMESTAMP
```

### 4.2 API Contracts

```typescript
// New Quick Action endpoint
accounting.payVendor = adminProcedure
  .input(z.object({
    vendorId: z.number(),
    amount: z.number().positive(),
    paymentType: z.enum(['CASH', 'CHECK', 'WIRE', 'ACH', 'OTHER']),
    note: z.string().optional(),
    referenceNumber: z.string().optional(),
    generateConfirmation: z.boolean().default(true)
  }))
  .output(z.object({
    paymentId: z.number(),
    previousBalance: z.number(),
    newBalance: z.number(),
    confirmationUrl: z.string().optional(),
    journalEntryId: z.number()
  }))
  .mutation(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
    // 1. Get current vendor balance (amount owed)
    // 2. Create vendor payment record
    // 3. Create journal entry (debit AP, credit cash/bank)
    // 4. Update vendor balance
    // 5. Generate confirmation if requested
    // 6. Return new balance and confirmation URL
  });

// Balance preview endpoint
accounting.previewVendorPaymentBalance = publicProcedure
  .input(z.object({
    vendorId: z.number(),
    amount: z.number()
  }))
  .output(z.object({
    currentOwed: z.number(),
    projectedOwed: z.number()
  }))
  .query(async ({ input }) => {
    // Return current and projected amount owed
  });
```

### 4.3 Integration Points

**Design Requirements:**
- Mirror WS-001 layout for consistency
- Modal width: 480px (centered)
- Vendor dropdown with search and recent vendors
- Amount field with currency formatting
- Reference # field for invoice/PO tracking
- Balance preview shows "Currently Owed" → "Remaining Owed"
- Color coding: payments reduce owed amount (green indicator)

### 5.3 Acceptance Criteria (UI)

- [ ] Modal opens within 200ms of clicking Quick Action
- [ ] Vendor dropdown shows recent vendors first, then alphabetical
- [ ] Amount field accepts numeric input only, formats with commas
- [ ] Balance preview updates within 300ms of amount change
- [ ] Form submits on Enter key when all required fields filled
- [ ] Success state shows confirmation preview with download/email options
- [ ] Error states clearly indicate what went wrong
- [ ] UI mirrors WS-001 for muscle memory consistency

## 6. Edge Cases & Error Handling

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| Vendor has no outstanding balance | Show "Currently Owed: $0.00", allow payment (creates prepayment) |
| Amount exceeds amount owed | Show info: "This will create a prepayment credit of $X" |
| Amount exceeds typical range (>$50K) | Show confirmation dialog: "Large payment - please confirm" |
| Network error during save | Show retry button, preserve form data |
| Concurrent payment by another user | Refresh balance, show warning if changed |
| Vendor not found | Show "Vendor not found" error, clear selection |

## 7. Testing Requirements

## 8. Migration & Rollout

### 8.1 Data Migration

`FEATURE_QUICK_VENDOR_PAYMENT` - Enable alongside WS-001 for consistent rollout.

### 8.3 Rollback Plan

1. Disable feature flag
2. Quick Action button hidden
3. Users fall back to standard Journal Entry flow
4. No data rollback needed

## 9. Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Time to complete payment | < 10 seconds | Analytics: form open → submit |
| Click count | ≤ 3 clicks | UX audit |
| Error rate | < 1% | Error logging |
| User adoption | 80% of vendor payments via Quick Action | Payment source tracking |

## 10. Open Questions

- [x] Should prepayments be allowed? **Yes, creates credit with vendor**
- [x] Should we require linking to specific bills? **No, optional for MVP**
- [ ] Should we support recurring vendor payments? **Defer to future enhancement**
