# Summary of Audio Feedback (NewRecording(2).m4a)

This document summarizes the key feedback and decisions from the user's audio memo regarding the VIP Client Portal feature list.

### 1. Authentication & Access
- **Decision:** Remove all team-related features.
- **Action:** The portal will have a single user sign-on per VIP client. Features #4, #5, #6, #7, and #8 (all team permissions and invitations) will be removed.

### 2. Dashboard
- **Decision:** Remove the "Action Center" and specific alerts.
- **Rationale:** The user wants an informational portal, not a system that "chastises" them. The focus should be on presenting data clearly.
- **Action:** The dashboard will be redesigned as a collection of "mini modules" for Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Credit Utilization, Listings, and the Leaderboard. Features #12, #13, and #14 will be removed.
- **UI Change:** Within the AR/AP modules, overdue items should be listed first and highlighted in red.

### 3. Financial Hub
- **Decision:** Simplify the financial hub significantly.
- **Action:**
    - Remove the Spending Trends Chart (#24).
    - Remove the AR/AP Aging Chart (#25).
    - Remove the Natural Language Smart Search (#26).
    - Remove all direct payment functionality (#31, #32). The portal is for information only.
- **Conditional Logic:** The Accounts Receivable module should only be visible if the client has outstanding AR. The same applies to Accounts Payable.

### 4. VIP Tier System
- **New Requirement (Admin-Side):** Add functionality to the main TERP settings page for internal users to manage the VIP Tier system's rules and parameters.

### 5. Interactive Credit Center
- **Decision:** Remove the interactive calculator.
- **Action:** Feature #44 will be removed.

### 6. Marketplace (Needs & Supply)
- **Needs (Buying):**
    - **Change:** The expiration duration (#54) must be a **required** field.
- **Supply (Selling):**
    - **Change (Strain):** The strain field (#62) must allow users to input a **new strain name** if it's not in the existing list.
    - **Change (Tags):** The strain field (#62) should also allow selection from a list of **existing tags**. Users cannot create new tags.
    - **Change (Price):** The asking price (#67) should allow for a **price range (min/max)**. If only one value is entered, it is treated as a firm price.

### 7. New Admin-Side Feature
- **New Requirement:** Internal ERP users need to be able to see the **last login date and time** for each VIP client to track portal engagement.
