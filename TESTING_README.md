# TERP Comprehensive Testing Initiative

**Objective**: Achieve world-class testing coverage for TERP to ensure maximum reliability and quality.

**Your Role**: Product expert. You define what to test (user flows) and validate the results. You do not need to write any code.

**Manus's Role**: Technical implementation. I will write all code, configure all tools, and run all tests.

## How This Works

This project is managed entirely within this GitHub repository. You don't need to copy/paste prompts or manage files. Here's the workflow:

1.  **You**: Tell me which phase to start (e.g., "Start Phase 1").
2.  **Manus**: I read the corresponding prompt from the `.manus/PROMPTS` directory.
3.  **Manus**: I execute the prompt and do all the technical work.
4.  **Manus**: When I need your input (e.g., to define a user flow), I'll ask you a specific question.
5.  **You**: Answer the question in plain English.
6.  **Manus**: I use your answer to continue the implementation.
7.  **Manus**: At the end of each phase, I'll ask for your validation.
