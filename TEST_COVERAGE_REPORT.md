- Bulk order fixed discounts
- Margin category classification (excellent, good, fair, low, negative)
- Due date calculations (NET_7, NET_15, NET_30, COD)
- Complex pricing scenarios (low-margin high-volume, premium pricing, consignment)

**Key Scenarios Tested**:
- ✅ Fixed COGS mode: $8.50 COGS → $12.00 sale = 29.17% margin
- ✅ Range COGS mode: $15-$25 range → $20 midpoint
- ✅ VIP discount: 15% off midpoint COGS
- ✅ Bulk discount: $1.50 per unit off
- ✅ Margin classification: 70%+ excellent, 50-70% good, 30-50% fair, 15-30% low, <15% negative

#### pricingEngine.integration.test.ts - 16 tests
**Purpose**: Test pricing rule engine with realistic rule combinations

**Coverage Areas**:
- Basic pricing operations (markup, markdown, dollar adjustments)
- Conditional pricing (category, strain, grade, vendor matching)
- Multiple rule combinations
- Rule priority ordering
- Edge cases (zero prices, negative prices, rounding)

**Key Scenarios Tested**:
- ✅ Percentage markup: 50% markup correctly applied
- ✅ Percentage markdown: 25% discount correctly applied
- ✅ Dollar markup: $5 fixed markup
- ✅ Dollar markdown: $7 fixed discount
- ✅ Category-based pricing: Flower products get specific markup
- ✅ Strain-specific pricing: Blue Dream gets premium
- ✅ Grade-based pricing: A+ grade gets 30% premium
- ✅ Vendor-based pricing: Premium vendors get surcharge
- ✅ Multiple rules: Applied in priority order
- ✅ Price clamping: Negative prices prevented

### 3. Unit Tests (30 existing tests)

#### cogsCalculator.test.ts - 21 tests
- COGS calculation logic
- Margin calculations
- Date calculations

#### pricingEngine.test.ts - 9 tests
- Pricing rule matching
- Rule application logic

## Areas for Future Improvement

### Database Integration Tests (Low Priority)
The current tests focus on business logic validation without requiring a full database setup. For true database integration tests, consider:
- Setting up a test database with migrations
- Testing actual database CRUD operations
- Testing transaction handling
- Testing database constraints and triggers

**Note**: This would increase coverage of `db.ts` (currently 2.12%) but requires infrastructure setup.

### API Endpoint Tests (Medium Priority)
Consider adding tests for:
- Express route handlers
- Request validation
- Response formatting
- Error handling middleware

### End-to-End Tests (Medium Priority)
Consider adding:
- Full workflow tests (quote creation → approval → conversion to sale)
- Multi-user scenarios
- Data integrity across operations
