Railway Deployment Error Analysis
===================================

Date: 2024-12-08
Session: Session-20251208-RAILWAY-FIX-8ce562

KEY ERROR IDENTIFIED:
--------------------
Error: Unknown column 'statusId' in 'field list'
SQL State: 42S22
SQL Message: Unknown column 'statusId' in 'field list'

Exit Code: 1 (ELIFECYCLE Command failed)

CONTEXT:
--------
The error occurs during database seeding when trying to insert batch data.
The seeding script is attempting to reference a column 'statusId' that doesn't exist in the database schema.

This is a SCHEMA DRIFT issue - the code expects columns that don't exist in the Railway MySQL database.

PREVIOUS KNOWN ISSUES (from documentation):
------------------------------------------
1. Missing column: 'vip_portal_enabled' 
2. Missing column: 'vip_portal_last_login'

NEW ISSUE DISCOVERED:
--------------------
3. Missing column: 'statusId' in batch/inventory related table

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
The seeding script is failing because the database schema on Railway doesn't match the code schema.
Multiple columns are missing, causing the seeding process to crash during startup.

SOLUTION STRATEGY:
-----------------
1. Set SKIP_SEEDING=true environment variable in Railway to bypass all seeding
2. This will allow the app to start without running the problematic seeding scripts
3. The app can function without seeded data for testing purposes
4. Schema drift can be fixed separately later

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Check if SKIP_SEEDING is already set in Railway
2. If not, set it via Railway CLI or dashboard
3. Trigger a new deployment
4. Verify app starts successfully
5. Test frontend and backend functionality
