# Railway Deployment Guide for TERP

## Overview

This guide will help you deploy TERP to Railway with **zero manual work after initial setup**. Railway will automatically deploy on every GitHub push, just like Vercel.

**Estimated Setup Time:** 5-10 minutes (one-time)  
**Future Deployments:** Automatic on every `git push`

---

## Prerequisites

- [x] GitHub account with TERP repository
- [x] Railway account (free - sign up at https://railway.app)
- [ ] Database credentials (MySQL)

---

## Step 1: Create Railway Account (1 minute)

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click "Login" or "Start a New Project"
3. Sign in with your GitHub account
4. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub repositories

**That's it!** Railway is now connected to your GitHub.

---

## Step 2: Create New Project (2 minutes)

### Option A: Via Railway Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Click "New Project" on Railway dashboard
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Search for and select **"EvanTenenbaum/TERP"**
4. Railway will automatically detect it as a Node.js app
5. Click "Deploy Now"

### Option B: Via Railway CLI (Alternative)

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Link to your project
cd /path/to/TERP
railway init

# Deploy
railway up
```

---

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables (3 minutes)

Railway needs the same environment variables that Vercel uses.

### Method 1: Copy from Vercel (Easiest)

If you have Vercel CLI installed:
```bash
# Export from Vercel
vercel env pull .env.production

# Import to Railway
railway variables --set-from-file .env.production
```

### Method 2: Manual Entry via Dashboard

1. Go to your Railway project
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Click "New Variable"
5. Add these variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@host:port/database
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-change-in-production
OPENAI_API_URL=your-openai-url (if using)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key (if using)
OAUTH_SERVER_URL=https://vidabiz.butterfly-effect.dev
VITE_APP_ID=proj_abc123def456
VITE_OAUTH_PORTAL_URL=https://vida.butterfly-effect.dev
VITE_APP_TITLE=TERP
VITE_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT=https://umami.dev.ops.butterfly-effect.dev
VITE_ANALYTICS_WEBSITE_ID=analytics_proj_abc123def456
```

**Important:** Copy the exact values from your Vercel environment variables.

### Method 3: Bulk Import via Railway CLI

```bash
# Set variables one by one
railway variables set DATABASE_URL="mysql://..."
railway variables set JWT_SECRET="your-secret"
# ... etc
```

---

## Step 4: Run Database Migration (One-time)

After the first deployment completes, you need to create the database tables.

### Option A: Via Railway CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# Connect to your Railway project
railway link

# Run the migration
railway run pnpm db:push
```

### Option B: Manual SQL Execution

1. Use the SQL migration file: `migrations/001_needs_and_matching_module.sql`
2. Connect to your MySQL database
3. Run the SQL file (see `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for details)

---

## Step 5: Verify Deployment (2 minutes)

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Wait for deployment to show "Success" (takes 2-3 minutes)
5. Click "View Logs" to see build output
6. Once deployed, Railway will show you a URL like: `https://terp-production.up.railway.app`

### Test Your Deployment

1. Visit the Railway URL
2. Check that the app loads
3. Navigate to `/needs` - Should show Needs Management page
4. Navigate to `/vendor-supply` - Should show Vendor Supply page
5. Open any client page - Should have "Needs & History" tab

---

## Step 6: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use your own domain:

1. Go to your Railway service
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll to "Domains"
4. Click "Add Domain"
5. Enter your domain (e.g., `terp.yourdomain.com`)
6. Railway will provide DNS records to add to your domain registrar
7. Add the CNAME record to your DNS
8. Wait for DNS propagation (5-30 minutes)

---

## Automatic Deployments (Zero Manual Work!)

**After initial setup, Railway automatically deploys on every GitHub push.**

### How it Works

1. You make changes to your code locally
2. Commit and push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. Railway automatically detects the push
4. Railway builds and deploys the new version
5. Your app is updated (takes 2-3 minutes)

**No manual steps required!** Just `git push` and Railway handles the rest.

---

## Monitoring & Logs

### View Deployment Status

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your TERP project
3. See deployment status in real-time

### View Application Logs

1. Go to your Railway service
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Click on any deployment
4. View logs in real-time

### Set Up Alerts (Optional)

1. Go to "Settings" tab
2. Scroll to "Notifications"
3. Add your email or Slack webhook
4. Get notified of deployment success/failures

---

## Environment Management

### Development vs Production

Railway automatically sets `NODE_ENV=production` for you.

### Update Environment Variables

**Via Dashboard:**
1. Go to "Variables" tab
2. Click on variable to edit
3. Save changes
4. Railway automatically redeploys

**Via CLI:**
```bash
railway variables set DATABASE_URL="new-value"
```

---

## Database Management

### Option 1: Use Railway's Built-in MySQL (Recommended)

Railway can provision a MySQL database for you:

1. Go to your project
2. Click "New" â†’ "Database" â†’ "Add MySQL"
3. Railway creates a MySQL instance
4. Automatically sets `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
5. Run migration: `railway run pnpm db:push`

**Benefits:**
- Automatic backups
- Managed by Railway
- No external database needed
- Free tier available

### Option 2: Use External Database

Keep using your existing MySQL database:
- Just set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Railway connects to your external database

---

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment Failed

**Check build logs:**
1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click on failed deployment
3. View logs to see error

**Common issues:**
- Missing environment variables â†’ Add them in "Variables" tab
- Build errors â†’ Check logs for specific error
- Database connection â†’ Verify `DATABASE_URL` is correct

### App Not Loading

**Check:**
1. Deployment status is "Success"
2. Logs show "Server running on port..."
3. Environment variables are set correctly
4. Database migration was run

### Database Connection Issues

**Verify:**
```bash
# Test database connection
railway run node -e "const mysql = require('mysql2/promise'); mysql.createConnection(process.env.DATABASE_URL).then(() => console.log('Connected!')).catch(console.error)"
```

### Port Issues

Railway automatically sets the `PORT` environment variable. Your app should use:
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
```

TERP already handles this correctly in `server/_core/index.ts`.

---

## Rollback to Previous Version

If a deployment breaks something:

1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Find the last working deployment
3. Click "..." menu
4. Click "Redeploy"

Railway will rollback to that version.

---

## Cost & Pricing

### Free Tier
- $5 free credit per month
- Enough for small projects
- No credit card required initially

### Paid Plans
- **Hobby:** $5/month (500 hours)
- **Pro:** $20/month (unlimited)

**For TERP:** Free tier should be sufficient for development/testing. Upgrade to Hobby for production.

---

## Migration from Vercel

### What to Update

1. **Frontend URL:** Update any hardcoded Vercel URLs to Railway URL
2. **API Endpoints:** Should work automatically (same codebase)
3. **Environment Variables:** Copy from Vercel to Railway
4. **Custom Domain:** Point to Railway instead of Vercel

### Keeping Both

You can keep Vercel for frontend-only and Railway for full-stack:
- Not recommended for TERP (adds complexity)
- Better to use Railway for everything

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Railway's Database
- Easier management
- Automatic backups
- Better performance (same region)

### 2. Set Up Notifications
- Get alerted on deployment failures
- Monitor app health

### 3. Use Environment Variables
- Never commit secrets to Git
- Use Railway's variables feature

### 4. Monitor Logs
- Check logs regularly
- Set up log drains for long-term storage

### 5. Enable Auto-Deploy
- Already enabled by default
- Deploys on every push to main branch

---

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. âœ… Verify app is running
2. âœ… Run database migration
3. âœ… Test all features
4. âœ… Set up custom domain (optional)
5. âœ… Configure notifications
6. âœ… Monitor first few deployments
